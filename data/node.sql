Many tools are offered to you to modify your picks. The game''s selling point is the fact that you can put the MySims into yourÂ photos. You select which Sim you want to use as wellÂ as his or her animation. These animations can vary fromÂ waving to sitting down to making a pizza. You can select the size and orientation of your Sim.

Most of the art is still realtime 3D. The game takes place in the over exposed white city we style that makes Mirror''s Edge so unique. In the iPad you play as Faith, the same female protagonist from the console version. Faith is a runner in a city that thrives on control. Runners are a cultish group of couriers for the liberal rebels, getting messages across the city, because all other forms of communication are tapped. Faith in this game doesn''t kill, she doesn''t use guns, she just runs and knocks out police. She traverses the screen by any means necessary, along roof tops using cranes and zip lines, in buildings through elevator shafts and air ducts, or below the city in parking garages or subways.</p><h2>Control / Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game is made specifically for the iPad and iPhone. There are no on-screen buttons or joystick. Swipe to the right and Faith runs to the right, running faster and faster until you tap the screen to make her stop. Swipe left and she turns and runs to the left. This game, like the original Mirror''s Edge, is all about speed, or flow. You want to keep running and you''ll move faster and faster, however there are obstacles in your way. Swipe up to jump over those obstacles or between buildings. Swipe down while running to slide underneath them. You can take enemies down with a slide or a jump kick performed by flicking up again to the right. The game steadily introduces new moves like wall runs, wall jumps, and wall slides.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1326549-mirrrorsplitscreen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1326549" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7303/1326549-mirrrorsplitscreen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1326549"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7303/1326549-mirrrorsplitscreen.jpg"></a><figcaption>Split Screen Mode</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is often compared to <a data-ref-id="3030-28976" href="/canabalt/3030-28976/" slug="canabalt">Canabalt</a>. However, Mirror''s Edge on the iPad has much more verticality as Faith can climb up and slide down buildings. There are also moments in which you have to chase after other runners and knock down enemies. Mirror''s Edge also has multiple routes, some faster than others, to get to the end and collectible messenger bags hidden all over the levels.</p><p style="">Mirror''s Edge also takes advantage of the iPad''s accelerometer. When you are sliding, zip lining, or walking a balance beam you can hold the iPad at an angle to affect Faith''s speed, or in the case of balance beam walking, her balance.</p><p style="">Mirror''s Edge also makes use of a checkpoint system. As you progress through a level, Faith will pass satellite dishes or security cameras that save your progress. Should Faith fall to her doom, the player automatically restarts from these checkpoints.</p><h2>Speedruns</h2><p style="">Speedruns are an integral part to the Mirror''s Edge experience. After completing the campaign you can return to any level to complete it faster. Racing against your previous run''s ghost. There are three levels of completion: 1) One star, finished in a reasonable time, 2) Two stars, finished with an impressive time, and 3) Three stars, which is a pretty perfect run.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style="">In Mirror''s Edge multiplayer the iPad screen is split in two. Each player controls their own runner on their own side of the screen and races to complete the level.</p><p style="">The iPhone version features no multiplayer, but does have the same leaderboard support found in the iPad version of the game.</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p style="">Mirror''s edge launched with the iPad for $12.99 through Apple''s App Store. EA calls it "an introductory price."</p><p style="">Mirror''s Edge for iPhone was released as a $4.99 app on September 2nd, 2010.</p><p style="">Mirror''s Edge for Windows Phone was released as a timed exclusive for Nokia Lumia phones on July 13, 2012.</p>', 8),

By using the "grab the world" button (RB on 360) in conjunction with a kickflip, the skater can catch the board mid-flip with the board paint-side-up for a darkslide. You must flip trick out of a darkslide in order to properly orient the board for landing. You can also perform underflips. After performing a standard flip trick, you can immediately pull the stick in the opposite direction to initiate an underflip. You can also hold either of the triggers to grab your board, and then press either A or X to perform bonelesses, no complies, and also foot plants. The final addition to the skating control system is the ability to drop in from various ramp surfaces. While on foot and approaching a lip, one can press and holding the mount the board button. You will assume the drop in position. Upon releasing the mount the board button (Y or triangle), your skater will drop in fluidly down the ramp.</p><p style="">New goals include camera goals that ask you to place the camera down before attempting to perform specific tricks. The Hall of Meat makes a return (but doesn''t activate automatically outside of challenges, as it is an optional feature in this game), as will a fully filmed full-motion video intro movie featuring the game''s licensed skaters.</p><p style="">In a Skate series first, players now have access to a full park creation system. This is in contrast to Skate 2, which only allowed the player to use the in game character model to physically move small ramps and rails, Skate 3 adds to this with an item-dropping tool that can be used anywhere (but usually not while engaged in a challenge). Players are be able to drop objects into the game world using a God-hand interface, unlock objects by progressing through the game, as well as unlock various types of environments in which to build your teams own private facility.</p><p style="">The graphics editor has also been overhauled. An updated version of the web-based graphics editor that accompanied Skate 2 is available online, allowing players to create custom graphics on the Skate website and then import those into Skate 3 for use with their characters'' merchandise.</p><p style="">Another new aspect of the game this year is the introduction of difficulty modes, with players being able to choose between ''Easy'', ''Normal'' and ''Hardcore'' mode respectively. ''Normal'' mode is pretty self explanatory, with similar game play to be found in Skate 2. ''Easy'' mode dumbs down the physics and adds increased suction into grinds for those not wanting much of a challenge, while ''Hardcore'' mode is the complete opposite, drastically increasing the weight of the skater and lowering the height of ollies, as well as almost completely turning off CPU assists in lining up grinds and pumping transitions on vert ramps (which is critical for maintaining speed). This feature turns the game into an almost sim-like recreation of skateboarding, something which real-life skaters and long time fans of the series have been requesting Black Box to include since the first game was released in 2008.</p><h2>Community Features</h2><p style="">Skate 3, like its predecessor''s, includes a robust set of features aimed at sharing, rating, and playing content created by you, your friends, and the rest of the world. Players can view and rate photos, movies, created graphics, and created skate parks, with the highest rated of each being featured on the Skate.Feed that all players see when first booting up the game.</p><p style="">A new feature added in Skate 3 is the ability to create Skate teams that can work together to complete certain storyline challenges, or compete against other skate teams in online competitions.</p><h2>Final list of skaters</h2><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12166" href="/mark-appleyard/3005-12166/" slug="mark-appleyard">Mark Appleyard</a></li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12181" href="/ray-barbee/3005-12181/" slug="ray-barbee">Ray Barbee</a></li><li>Joey Brezinski</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12151" href="/dennis-busenitz/3005-12151/" slug="dennis-busenitz">Dennis Busenitz</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5354" href="/john-cardiel/3005-5354/" slug="john-cardiel">John Cardiel</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-71903" href="/mike-carrol/3040-71903/" slug="mike-carrol">Mike Carrol</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-9504" href="/chris-cole/3040-9504/" slug="chris-cole">Chris Cole</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11735" href="/jason-dill/3005-11735/" slug="jason-dill">Jason Dill</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-13968" href="/dan-drehobl/3005-13968/" slug="dan-drehobl">Dan Drehobl</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-5352" href="/rob-dyrdek/3005-5352/" slug="rob-dyrdek">Rob Dyrdek</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-67085" href="/patrick-duffy/3040-67085/" slug="patrick-duffy">Pat Duffy</a></li><li>Benny Fairfax</li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12155" href="/ryan-gallant/3005-12155/" slug="ryan-gallant">Ryan Gallant</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3040-89792" href="/chris-haslam/3040-89792/" slug="chris-haslam">Chris Haslam</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-11733" href="/jerry-hsu/3005-11733/" slug="jerry-hsu">Jerry Hsu</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-15132" href="/josh-kalis/3005-15132/" slug="josh-kalis">Josh Kalis</a></li></ul><ul><li><a data-ref-id="3005-12154" href="/terry-kennedy/3005-12154/" slug="terry-kennedy">Terry Kennedy</a></li><li><a data-ref-id="3005-6031" href="/eric-koston/3005-6031/" slug="eric-koston">Eric Koston</a></li><li>P.J.

With the help of <a href="../../hasbro-interactive-inc/65-531/" rel="nofollow"> Hasbro</a>''s streamlined 2008 RISK rules, RISK: Factions objective-based rules make for a much quicker game. The objective-based rules revolve around victory conditions that require the completion of three objectives while holding onto a "capital city", chosen by each player at the start of the game. In a two player game there is a total of five objectives, while that number will increase as the amount of players increases. These objectives are shared across all players in the game, so competition is high to complete an objective first. By completing an objective, a player is rewarded with a certain bonus. These vary from building an airport on a chosen territory, to the ability of using an extra attack die during combat.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">In the classic tradition of RISK, players will duel head-to-head by rolling dice to determine the victor. The player with the highest dice role on each successive die will win, while ties favor the defending player. In addition to classic dice rules, players will be able to trigger "overkill" moments if they correctly roll the dice: a roll of a double six will destroy all enemy forces. Although a "fast battle" option is available during combat, players can witness comical attack animations to lend a bit of entertainment to the sometimes boring task of dice rolling.</p><h3>Dynamic Terrain</h3><p style="">With the addition of multiple maps in RISK: Factions comes a dynamic element to those maps. Volcanoes and dams can be used to drastically alter the game map. For instance, if the player takes over a dam they have the ability to trigger a flood that will wipe out nearby territories and everything contained in them.</p><h3>Additional Map Elements</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1247277-10.14.61.23_image20copy1024x576.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1247277" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1247277-10.14.61.23_image20copy1024x576.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1247277"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1247277-10.14.61.23_image20copy1024x576.jpg"></a><figcaption>The campaign uses a unique set of smaller maps</figcaption></figure><p style="">Probably the biggest advantage a player can have in the game is to control the Temple. The player must control all 3 bordering territories, and once held for a turn, the player can then choose an opposing territory to convert to their side. While it is hard to capture in a game against humans, the Temple can be used to turn a game completely around. Another big map feature is the missile which can be controlled by capturing 3 barracks that are spread across the map. Capturing the missile gives an extra die to the controlling player in surrounding territories. Shrines are the last remaining map element. When the player controls 3 shrines (out of 4), they gain the ability to "freeze" any territory on the map for the next turn, thereby making troops move around it and prohibiting the use of any troops that were on said space.</p><h2>Factions</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66392/1415821-snapshot_275.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1415821" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66392/1415821-snapshot_275.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1415821"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66392/1415821-snapshot_275.jpg"></a><figcaption>Can''t they all just get along?</figcaption></figure><p style="">Five uniquely different factions battle it out in Factions Mode, with each faction representing a particular color in the game board.

This engine is called locomotion and deals with speed, acceleration, and, agility. Player movement will be more responsive and based off of acceleration, momentum, and direction. The Madden NFL development team did a <a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=acf65c8409/template=easportsmaddennfl001/width=640/height=800" rel="nofollow">live chat</a> on the new locomotion engine.</p><blockquote><p style="">The Madden NFL development team said,"The big 3 for locomotion are Speed, Accel, and Agility. Agility is the most important rating for changing of directions, followed closely by Acceleration (need to get back up to speed after slowing down to cut or turn at high speed). If I had to rank them I''d put Speed and Accel roughly even with Agility close behind. Last year Accel and Agility weren''t on the same planet as speed. :)</p></blockquote><p style="">From early gameplay footage the new Locomotion engine appears to have fixed a few flaws present in older Maddens. Lineman no longer teleport to predetermined locations and no longer get stuck into "suction" blocking. Because of the addition of speed, acceleration, and agility rating linemen seem to actually plant their legs and be forced to move around the pocket that way.</p><p style=""><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=CatchTuning" rel="nofollow">Catching</a> has been tuned to fix bugs in previous versions where receivers would run backwards, not recognize the sideline, or make no attempt to stay in bounds on a touchdown catch. The Madden NFL development team did a <a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=6ccbb416b2/template=easportsmaddennfl001/width=640/height=800" rel="nofollow">live chat</a> on the tuning made to catching.</p><p style="">The debut trailer was released at midnight on Thursday, April 22, 2010 on Spike TV after the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. With the mantra, "Simpler, Quicker, Deeper" the video revealed GameFlow, an all-new play-calling system similar to what an NFL quarterback would experience in a real game. GameFlow is intended to keep players in the action for as long as possible, reducing time spent in the playbook and enabling players to complete games quicker. GameFlow is however a very deep system as players can fully customize sets of plays to use during online or offline games. Players can also rate their favorite plays up to 5 stars(think iTunes) to make creating their favorite sets of plays easier. During the game coaches will instruct the player on what play is being run through their headset. The game will not simply state the name of the play like "X,Y,Z Flex" but instead will instruct the player on what to expect. For example "the TE will cut across the middle of the field after 15 yards, try to read the linebacker to see if he is covered".</p><p style="">The most drastic change is the removal of the Turbo button; a long standing tradition of the Madden franchise. A player will always attempt to run at top speed when the play dictates it. A players ability to outrun defenders or find the hole is entirely based off of their new ratings instead of the holding down of an arbitrary "accelerator". The Turbo button can be turned back on in the options.</p><p style="">Dual Stick Control switches over controls for all juke moves to the right analog stick instead of face buttons; all juke moves are analog and based off of the amount of pressure applied to the right stick. A spin is no longer the same for every player, you can spin less or more based on the movement of the right stick. It is possible for poorly rated players to be unable to achieve certain juke moves resulting in them falling flat on their face.</p><p style="">Other new features include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=locomotion" rel="nofollow">Locomotion</a></li><li><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=CatchTuning" rel="nofollow">Catch Tuning</a></li><li><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=DualStick" rel="nofollow">Dual Stick Control</a></li><li><a href="http://maddennfl.easports.com/blog.action?blogId=gameflow_gameplanning" rel="nofollow">Game Flow &amp; Game Planning</a></li></ul><h2><a data-ref-id="3015-1641" href="/demo/3015-1641/" slug="demo"><b>Demo</b></a></h2><p style="">For the first time, <a data-ref-id="3010-422" href="/ea-tiburon/3010-422/" slug="ea-tiburon">EA Tiburon</a> let fans vote for the two teams that would be matched up in the demo for Madden NFL 11.

On January 11th, 2013, the online servers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the original game were shut down.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">NBA Jam is a fast-pace arcade style 2-on-2 basketball game that plays very similarly to the 1993 arcade game of the same name. Their are no fouls in NBA Jam other than goal tending (interfering with the ball when it is on the way to the basket) and shot clock violation (24 second shot clock expires before a shot is taken). Since their are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987786" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987786"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1987786-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Trail of fire</figcaption></figure><p style="">If the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become "on fire" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.</p><p style=""><b>Game Types</b></p><p style="">In addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.</p><p style="">In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 <a href="/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/" data-ref-id="3015-218">AI</a> opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.</p><p style="">In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard''s life meter is completely empty, the backboard''s glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.</p><p style="">In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the "paint". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.</p><p style="">Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.</p><p style="">2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains <a href="/power-up/3015-700/" data-ref-id="3015-700">power-ups</a>. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987783" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1987783"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1987783-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Magic Johnson boss battle</figcaption></figure><p style=""><b>Campaigns</b></p><p style="">NBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.</p><p style="">Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with <a href="/magic-johnson/3005-6543/" data-ref-id="3005-6543">Magic Johnson</a>, Magic Johnson has the ability to <a href="/teleportation/3015-8/" data-ref-id="3015-8">teleport</a> around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters</p><h2>Standard Roster</h2><p style="">The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season. Unlike the original <a href="/nba-jam/3030-16928/" data-ref-id="3030-16928">NBA Jam</a>, in which teams are divided in the Team Selection Screen into Eastern and Western conferences, this installment lists all teams alphabetically. Each team has 3-4 standard players, and most teams have additional <a href="/unlockables/3015-1414/" data-ref-id="3015-1414">unlockable</a> "legends" (Former NBA

This battle was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anaconda" rel="nofollow">Operation Anaconda</a>. This large scale operation had as a goal to root out Taliban forces hiding in the surrounding mountains. The operation was lead from March 1, 2002 until March 19, 2002. The American lead coalition succeeded in hunting the Taliban out of the region and as the game indicates, the Taliban numbers were estimated to be up to 1,000 troops strong. The operation involved both US and Afghan forces, like in the game, and the Taliban suffered losses of about 500 causalities which is probably the body count the player will find themselves with by the end of the game. Of course, the Generals and Colonels leading the operation don''t have the same names as the ones who lead the actual operation (Anaconda was lead in real life by LTG. Franklin L. Hagenbeck).</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In the game, the player is tasked with capturing the Bagram Airfield. This airfield really exists and has been under US control since December 2001. This airfield is extremely important as it houses part of the US Marines and air forces in Afghanistan. It''s also one of the few airfields in Afghanistan where Air Force One is authorized to land.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Tier 1 operators that the player play as did not exist even though certain team mates of the player00 such as Dusty have existed in the past. One of Medal of Honor''s main protagonists, pictured on the box art, is rumored to be a real veteran of the current war in Afghanistan. He is currently referred to as a "Tier 1 Operator," nicknamed "Cowboy", and works for the National Command Authority. These operators are part of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Tier 1 operators are trained in counter terrorism and can only be deployed by the President or the Defense Secretary. The game also has you playing as Tier 2 operatives (US Army Rangers) and Tier 3 operatives (10th Mountain Division).</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game starts as US Army Rangers are in the back of a helicopter, flying over a snowy valley. The first word uttered by the game is "fuck", which sets the tone. We don''t know what these Rangers are doing in this valley but the soldier manning the gun thinks they''re crazy. A man who seems to be the commanding officer jumps out of the helicopter first. Just when his feet brutally hit the ground, rockets fly everywhere and hit the helicopter knocking you, the player, out of the helicopter, at which point you black out.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game flashes back 6 weeks. As the opening credits roll, the camera pans around planet earth. During this sequence, the story manages to explain why the U.S. are in Afghanistan without ever using the phrase "9/11", as if hearing the nickname of the attack would cause patriotic Americans to burst into tears. You hear news broadcasts including which say the words "beautiful morning in NYC", "live from downtown New York", "Dark smoke coming from the Pentagon"... You also hear the military talking amongst themselves. They''re talking about the Taliban and how they''re playing planing something big, which has been referred to as the "wedding". The camera zooms in onto Afghanistan and gives a birds eye view of Afghanistan land through a <a href="/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/" data-ref-id="3055-3350">UAV</a> drone.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The camera descends into the perspective of Rabbit, a Tier 1 soldier part of AFO Neptune. He''s riding in white trucks with the three other soldiers of his squad (Mother, Voodoo, Preacher) towards the village of Gardez. They''re tasked with meeting with an informant called Tariq. Tariq has told his militia friends that Neptune was coming which facilitates their entry into the town. The militia tells the squad that the Taliban have apparently left the town so there''s no need to worry. Despite this fact, the squad is still on edge. They arrive on a street where the garbage cans are on fire and a truck blocks their passage. Suddenly, terrorists appear. These terrorists are Chechens, which is bad news. A rocket hits the truck in front of Rabbit, and Voodoo puts the truck in reverse and drives it right through a building. The truck being too banged up to work anymore, the two soldiers make their way by foot to meet up with the two other squad mates, Mother and Preacher who''ve apparently survived despite their truck blowing up.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554368" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1554368"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1554368-moh_screen_07.jpg"></a><figcaption>Neptune getting it done.</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The squad manages to "link up" and deduce that Tariq has ratted them out since the Taliban was waiting for them. They still decide to head for the house where the rendezvous was planned. On the way there they kill hundreds of "bad guys" as they call them before accessing the house. They go to the second floor where a dead, brutally wounded man sits tied to an office chair. Neptune first think this is Tariq but realize that it is not. Suddenly they begin to hear beeping coming from inside the body and realize, almost too late, that the body is booby trapped. Mother kicks the chair back onto the balcony where the body blows up taking out the front of the house. Neptune radios Command asking them where is Tariq to which they respond that a <a href="/central-intelligence-agency/3015-2988/" data-ref-id="3015-2988">CIA</a> drone may have found him in a nearby fort. This is the first, and certainly not the last, time that the characters onscreen begin questioning their intel.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Neptune arrives at the fort and discovers that it''s not only heavily guarded but also inaccessible due to a huge front gate. Command sends a predator missile, making the squad experience danger close, and Neptune enters the fort, killing Taliban. They search every room of the fort for Tariq and eventually find him being held at gun point. They take care of his captors and go to a rendezvous point to hand him off to the CIA. Tariq tells the squad that they must counter attack Al Qaeda and the Taliban. According to him, the Taliban have a large contingency of soldiers and weapons in Shah-i-Kot valley. Once again, this proves that intel was wrong.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">AFO Neptune and a squad of local soldiers are tasked with taking an airfield in Bagram. This heavily protected airfield eventually falls and becomes a forward operating base for US forces. The base is under the control of colonel Drucker. Drucker''s superior is General Flagg. Flagg is a stereotype of certain American generals while Drucker shows a much more patriotic type of America. Flagg is actually in the US with a nice office with a nice view that looks on some nice looking palm trees. Drucker on the other hand is neck deep in Afghan territory. They have very conflicting views. Drucker wants the AFO to go on recon and the Afghan army to eliminate the army, limiting American losses and letting the Afghans win their war. Flagg wants to deploy different army divisions and the Rangers to go and kill the Taliban in the mountains. Drucker proves that what the general is asking is dumb but Flagg gives Drucker 24 hours to do what he said or else.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The player then takes control of AFO Wolfpack. You play as Deuce while your other team mates go by the names of Dusty, Panther and Vegas. Deuce and Dusty ride on quad bikes and spot Taliban convoys in the area. They soon discover that these convoys are actually full of weapons and go on a stealth mission to mark them all with a beacon so allied forces can take them out. The action switches back to Rabbit who paints the convoys for US missiles to destroy. At the same time, Drucker has inserted Afghan forces to go hunting for the Taliban. Flagg calls in a rage. At the same time, AFO Wolfpack approach a column of unknown vehicles. Flagg being intensely angry with Drucker orders an AC-130 strike on said vehicles. The vehicles were actually those of the Afghan army and of the US and friendly fire ensues leading the Afghans to retreat. Drucker having lost the Afghans has no other choice but to call in the Rangers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Rangers are called in and are all super pumped ("Hooah !"). They land in a valley and first think that there is no enemy. Suddenly, they find themselves under heavy weapons fire and rockets fly through the air, shooting down US helicopters. Bodies drop but your squad manages to make it out safe. You play as Specialist Dante Adams and you and your squad are tasked in destroying the Taliban''s heavy machine guns that</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556893-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556893" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556893-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556893"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1556893-1.png"></a><figcaption>Landing</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">are raining death onto the valley. You eventually destroy the machine guns thanks to a Predator missile and make your way down to a small village to get picked up. The village seems calm. One of your squad mates approaches a door and just when he utters the words "cellphone" the house blows up in your squad''s face. You and your team manage to get back up but Taliban start running down the hills in all directions. The Rangers try to take cover behind rubble but there are just too many bad guys. They call in for air support but realize that none is in the area. They also realize that they have no more ammo. The Rangers call off air support since they won''t be able to survive long enough for it to arrive and wish Command "Good Luck". Just as they''re about to be overrun, Apache helicopters appear and narrowly save the lucky Rangers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">You take control of the Apaches as they shoot up the neighboring mountains and Taliban bases. After eliminating an entire village, the Apaches are about to go home when an AAA gun suddenly appears. Right before the helicopters are blown to pieces, the Taliban manning the AAA gun is shot in the head. The shot came from Deuce and Dusty who are on the opposite mountain. They''re sniping nearby Taliban and are in contact with Neptune who are on the opposite mountain. Neptune lures the Taliban into Wolfpack''s line of fire, killing the insurgents. Eventually, the Taliban are too numerous and Neptune is forced to retreat over the mountain ridge.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">You take control once again of Rabbit. Neptune makes a run down the mountain to escape the Taliban. They make it to the LZ but due to RPG fire it gets too hot and the Chinook leaves without Preacher and Voodoo. Mother and Rabbit promise to come back for them since their helicopter has been hit and must return to base. Mother mounts an operation and returns into the mountains at night to look for the two lost squad members. Their helicopter is attacked and Rabbit and Mother are forced to jump. They get separated but eventually meet up. However they seize the attention of the Taliban and end up being chased by them. They lock themselves up in a hut that is destroyed by an RPG. Mother drags a wounded Rabbit who manages to get up but who is combat inefficient. The two Americans get cornered at the edge of a cliff and decide to jump. They land many meters later and fall into the hands of the Taliban.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1557110-3.png" data-ref-id="1300-1557110" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1557110-3.png" data-ref-id="1300-1557110"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112064/1557110-3.png"></a><figcaption>Command</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Drucker manages locate the two captured soldiers and wants to send a team to save them. Flagg disagrees with this and doesn''t want to risk anymore losses. Flagg and Drucker get into an argument to the point where the colonel decides to disobey orders and cuts communications with Flagg. An AC-130 is in the area and the only way to know which ones are Mother and Rabbit is to send a single missile near the group of Taliban. The ones who don''t run away are the two prisoners. Drucker sends in a special team to go save the two soldiers.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Chinook in which the rescue team is flying is shot down. The game shows you what a helicopter crash looks like from inside of a helicopter, where bodies bounce around in slow motion while enemy bullets tear through its armor with ease. After this spectacular crash, the squad goes through many Taliban before finding Voodoo and Preacher. After more looking and with the help of a CIA Predator drone they find Mother and Rabbit. The player''s point of view changes to Rabbit''s as he tries to stay alive despite his wounds. His team mates try to reassure him but sadly there is no air support in the area to pick up Rabbit.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Rabbit dies of his wounds and the rest of the team is evacuated via Chinook.

Danger Close is assigned to make the single player campaign while DICE will be developing the multiplayer portion of the game. Additionally, DCG is using <a href="/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/" data-ref-id="3015-86">Unreal Engine 3</a> to make the single player campaign, while DICE will employ their own <a href="/frostbite-engine/3015-1095/" data-ref-id="3015-1095">Frostbite Engine</a> to create the multiplayer.

The game is played in first person with the gun being slightly on the right side of the screen. All of the weapons that the player use can be more precise when the player looks down the weapon''s iron sights. Some weapons only have iron sights where the player must aim by pointing the weapon at the enemy, look down the sights and place the enemy right above the the middle vertical part of the sight. Some weapons have more precise aiming attachments such as the red dot. This sight is a lens on which you see a red dot that tells you what you''re aiming at. This dot is actual the result of a laser that''s pointing out of your weapon and that indicates where you''re aiming. Some weapons, such as sniper rifles have scopes that can zoom in on a target. These scopes can also detect an enemy''s heat signatures.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In <i>Medal of Honor</i>, the player can carry around three weapons at once. He usually starts off the mission with a heavy and light weapon (for example, an assault rifle and an uzi). He also possesses a pistol. The pistol is given to him on every mission, sometimes silenced. This pistol has unlimited ammo and can be accessed by quickly hitting the weapon swap button twice. Ammo is given to the player at the beginning of a mission and he can replenish his ammo by going up to one of his squad mates and asking him for some. It''s to be noted that when you reload your weapon, if a bullet is already in the chamber before you reload it stays in the chamber, giving you one extra bullet to shoot per magazine. The player will also encounter special weapons during certain events. For example, he may be asked to use a large sniper rifle for long range shots. During this sequence, the player must take the wind and distance into account. At other times, the player may have to use a Soflam to guide missiles to the desired target.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><i>Medal of Honor</i> offers some player movement that isn''t regularly seen in modern day shooters. You can lean from left to right by holding down the lean button (L1 on PS3, LB on 360). You have unlimited sprint. You can also slide. Slide is done while sprinting. While sprinting, hit the crouch/prone button and the character will slide a short distance. This is useful for getting into cover. You can crouch and lay prone, when you move while in prone, the character will move his head and arms to make the player feel like he''s really crawling. The player can keep tabs on how much ammo he has left, what weapons he has equipped, where his squad mates are and where his objective is by hitting up on the control pad. You can also choose the ammo type with the control pad. You can choose to change your weapon from auto to semi-auto.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556968-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556968" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/1556968-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1556968"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/112064/1556968-1.png"></a><figcaption>Apache Gunship</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0"><i>Medal of Honor</i> offers some unique gameplay experiences during certain levels. One level has the player driving an ATV. The ATV is driven like any other vehicle. It can accelerate, brake and reverse. It can also power slide and the player can turn the head lights off for stealth. In one mission, the player is firing Hellfire missiles and heavy machine gun rounds from an Apache helicopter. The Hellfire missiles can only be fired at enemies in front of you while the heavy machine gun can fire in almost every direction except directly behind the Apache.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Weapons included in the single-player and multiplayer games:</p><ul><li><b>Assault Rifles</b>: <a href="/ak-47/3055-187/" data-ref-id="3055-187">AK-47</a>, <a href="/m16a4/3055-339/" data-ref-id="3055-339">M16A4</a>,</li></ul><ul><li><b>Carbines</b>: <a href="/m4a1/3055-549/" data-ref-id="3055-549">M4A1</a>, <a href="/aks-74u/3055-1331/" data-ref-id="3055-1331">AKS-74U</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sub-Machine Guns</b>: <a href="/mp7/3055-2508/" data-ref-id="3055-2508">MP7A1 ,</a> <a href="/fn-p90/3055-615/" data-ref-id="3055-615">P90TR</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>Shotguns</b>: <a href="/toz-194/3055-3487/" data-ref-id="3055-3487">TOZ-194</a>, <a href="/remington-870/3055-1355/" data-ref-id="3055-1355">870MCS</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sniper Rifles</b>: <a href="/m21-sniper-rifle/3055-1882/" data-ref-id="3055-1882">M21</a>, <a href="/m24/3055-1335/" data-ref-id="3055-1335">M24</a>, <a href="/svd-dragunov/3055-320/" data-ref-id="3055-320">SVD</a>, <a href="/sv-98/3055-1352/" data-ref-id="3055-1352">SV-98</a> , <a href="/m110-sass/3055-2513/" data-ref-id="3055-2513">M-110</a>, <a href="/barrett-m82/3055-3886/" data-ref-id="3055-3886">M82</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>Machine Guns</b>: <a href="/m249-saw/3055-623/" data-ref-id="3055-623">M249</a>, <a href="/pkm/3055-1327/" data-ref-id="3055-1327">PKM</a> , <a href="/m60/3055-1324/" data-ref-id="3055-1324">MK43</a>(M60E4 with RAS)</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pistols</b>: <a href="/m9-pistol/3055-940/" data-ref-id="3055-940">Beretta M9</a> , <a href="/sig-sauer-p226/3055-2962/" data-ref-id="3055-2962">SIG-Sauer P226</a>, <a href="/mp-443-grach/3055-3490/" data-ref-id="3055-3490">MP-443</a></li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1411776" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1411776"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13474/1411776-moh__12_.jpg"></a><figcaption>Firing at enemies in multiplayer</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Multiplayer was built entirely by DICE and is separate from the single player campaign. It''s interesting to know that when the game is booted up, the single player portion automatically loads. If you select multiplayer from the menu, the game goes to a separate load screen to load the mode.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Multiplayer is similar to other multiplayer modes in modern shooters. It''s class-based, has killstreaks, and uses experience points for persistent progression. Unlike other EA online games, Medal of Honor does not require an online pass to access the multiplayer component. This was probably done to keep it competitive with Activision''s Call of Duty series.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The gameplay for this mode is different from the single player. The controls have changed and certain actions that were present in the single player are absent from the multiplayer. For example, in multiplayer, you cannot slide, lean or go prone. You also can''t carry a third weapon. Unlimited sprint remains the same. The controls are very similar to what can be found in DICE''s last multiplayer focused game <a href="/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/" data-ref-id="3030-25246">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The multiplayer also has a different HUD: the ammo is marked differently and multiplayer adds a minimap. This minimap shows the location of your squad mates and enemy locations when they fire their weapon or the UAV is online. The score of the current game is also displayed on the bottom left as well as your killstreak progress which starts at 0/50.</p><h3>Classes</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The multiplayer offers the choice of 3 classes to the player: Rifleman, Special Ops and Sniper. By choosing a class and earning points in the game, either by killing enemies, accomplishing objectives or using support actions, the player earns points specific to the class he''s playing as. The player can play as one of two teams: Coalition or Opposing Forces (ex Taliban). Both teams use different weapons, weapons that can be unlocked by gaining levels (the game caps at level 15). Here is the full unlock tree for each class:</p><h3><u>Rifleman</u></h3><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Assault Rifle (M16A4 or AK-47)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Red Dot Scope (increases accuracy)</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Light Machine Gun (M249 or Kalashnikov PKM)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Suppressor (silences weapon but decreases range)</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Open-Tip Ammunition (increases damage)</li><li><b>Elite</b>: Long Range Combat Scope (increases range)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Muzzle Brake (increases accuracy)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: F2000 Assault Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Assault Rifle (call sign)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Light Machine Gun (call sign)</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Assault Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Light Machine Gun</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h3><u>Special Ops</u></h3><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Carbine (Colt M4A1 or Kalashnikov AKS-74U)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Red Dot Scope</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Combat Shotgun (Remington 870-MCS or Tula Arms TOZ-194)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Suppressors (reduces range)</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Slugs/Open-Tip Ammunition</li><li><b>Elite</b>: Long Range Combat Scopes</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Laser Sights</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: P90 PDW</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Carbines</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Combat Shotguns</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Carbine</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Combat Shotgun</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h3><u>Sniper</u></h3><ol><li><b>Recruit</b>: Battle Rifle (M21 or Norinco NDM-86)</li><li><b>Regular</b>: Extra Magazine</li><li><b>Expert</b>: Long Range Combat Scope</li><li><b>Veteran</b>: Bolt Action Sniper Rifles (M24 or Izhmash SV-98)</li><li><b>Operator</b>: Laser Rangefinder</li><li><b>Commander</b>: Open-Tip Ammunition</li><li><b>Elite</b>: High Power Scopes</li><li><b>Tier 1 Recruit</b>: Suppressors</li><li><b>Tier 1 Regular</b>: G3 Battle Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Expert</b>: Veteran Battle Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Veteran</b>: Veteran Sniper Rifle</li><li><b>Tier 1 Operator</b>: Enemy Battle Rifles</li><li><b>Tier 1 Commander</b>: Pistol Ammo</li><li><b>Tier 1 Elite</b>: Enemy Sniper Rifles</li><li><b>Tier 1 Warfighter</b>: Extra Grenade</li></ol><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Medal of Honor comes with 4 different multiplayer game modes plus a Hardcore mode that eliminates the HUD and boosts damage. There is also an "all game modes" mode that puts you into any available match. At the end of each match, a short cutscene ends the match.</p><h3><u>Team Assault</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Like the game suggests, this is regular 12 vs. 12 team deathmatch where two teams (Coalition or Op For) must kill each other to earn points. The game ends when time runs out or when the score limit is reached by one of the two teams.</p><h3><u>Sector Control</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Sector Control is a Domination game mode where two teams fight to control three different control points. Each team usually spawns next to one control point and the third one is usually in the middle of the two spawn points. To capture a control point, a team has to stay in a certain area around a flag point and raise his team''s flag (the US flag or the Taliban Flag). Capturing a control point will net 20 points to each player who helped capture the control point.</p><h3><u>Objective Raid</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This is the same game mode found in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 only on a smaller scale. One team defends two objectives while the other team must place a bomb on it. Once the bomb is placed, the defending team will have a limited amount of time to disarm it. The beeping noise that the objective makes when the bomb is armed is exactly the same as in Bad Company. This mode lasts five minutes per round.</p><h3><u>Combat Mission</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Another Battlefield classic, Combat mission tasks one team to complete objectives while the opposing team tries to stop them. When the attacking team completes an objective, the map opens up to another batch of objectives. The attacking team wins if they complete all the objectives in the set time.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Medal of Honor''s maps are both original and taken from the singleplayer. Each map can be played on multiple game modes while certain maps are exclusive to Combat Mission.</p><h3><u>Diwagal Camp</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Diwagal camp is a mix of both village and cave combat. One side of the map is situated in a cave while the other in a destroyed town. In the middle of the area is a road with a destroyed tank in the middle. The cave side of the map is ideal for sniping while the village ruins encourage close quarters combat. This map is playable in Team Assault, Objective Raid and Sector Control. In Sector Control, one flag is in the caves, the second in the town and the third one in the middle of the wide open road making capture not an easy task.</p><h3><u>Garmzir Town</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">Garmzir Town is a small town with many tight corners, alleyways and visually crowded marketplaces. The map is broken into two separate sectors with a river running in the middle. Said river is particularly exposed to sniper fire thanks to the many small buildings that border it. The map is playable in Objective Raid, Team Assault and Sector Control.</p><h3><u>Kandahar Marketplace</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This marketplace can best be described as a sniper''s paradise. Visually extremely crowded with a wide color palette that makes hiding easy. Many tall building give sharpshooters the edge while close quarters guerrilla warfare can be useful in the long alleyways and for getting rid of the snipers in the narrow buildings. This map can be played in Team Assault, Sector Control and Objective Raid.</p><h3><u>Kabul City Ruins</u></h3><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This is a small urban map with a main two story building that''s usually the center of attention. There are also some side streets that are ideal for urban combat. This map is playable in sector control, Team Assault and Objective Raid.</p><h2>Multiplayer beta</h2><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Multiplayer beta for Medal of Honor started on June 21, 2010 for anyone who pre-ordered the game, although VIPs of <a href="/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/" data-ref-id="3030-25246">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a> were able to start playing a few days earlier, on the 17th. The beta includes two maps &amp; modes; Combat Mission mode in Helmand Valley and Team Assault mode in Kabul City.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The game was supposed to come out on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. However, the Xbox version has been delayed multiple times, forcing EA to extend the duration of the beta on other platforms to line up with the eventual Xbox beta. The delay was announced on the Medal of Honor blog by Matt Pruit:</p><blockquote><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">The Medal of Honor beta for the Xbox 360 is delayed, but it is expected to be available next week. We are extremely disappointed about this, but want to assure you that we are dedicated and determined to delivering all of you this awesome multiplayer experience as soon as possible. However, we are excited to extend the beta to make up for lost time!</p></blockquote><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">This was written on June 17, 2010 but since then the beta has been repeatedly delayed for the 360. A month after that post, Matt Pruit announced that the beta was being extended on PS3 and PC, with beta cards still working after the expected July 18th, 2010 expiration date. This was done so the Xbox version could line up with the other versions.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">On October 4th, an open beta for the PC players only was available with two new maps and modes. The beta ended October 7th; anyone could have downloaded and played the game. The two maps included were: <i><b>Shahikot mountains</b></i> and <b><i>Kunar Base</i></b> . The modes included in the Open Beta were: <i>Combat Mission</i> and <i>Sector Control</i> .</p><h2>Limited Edition</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441149" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1441149"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/23298/1441149-340x_medalofhonor.jpg"></a><figcaption>The PS3 Limited Edition</figcaption></figure><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">It was announced at <a href="/e3-2010/3015-4529/" data-ref-id="3015-4529">E3 2010</a> that the Limited Edition version of Medal of Honor released on the Playstation 3 would exclusively include a high definition remastered version of <a href="/medal-of-honor-frontline/3030-4857/" data-ref-id="3030-4857">Medal of Honor: Frontline</a>.

Under pressure however EA has now removed the Taliban name from the multiplayer and now simply renamed the playable faction to "Opposing Force", similar to what games such as <a href="/">Modern Warfare 2</a> have done. Electronic Arts has released a <a href="/">statement</a> and wrote that they made the name switch because of feedback they received from families of servicemen and women deployed in the conflict. The single player campaign remains unchanged and the player will engage the insurgency designated the Taliban.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum Configuration<b>:</b></h3><ul><li><b>OS:</b> Wi<i>ndows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7</i></li><li><i><b>Processor:</b> Pentium D, 3.2GHz / Core 2 Duo, 2.0GHz / Athlon 64 X2</i></li><li><i><b>Memory:</b> 2GB RAM</i></li><li><i><b>Video Card:</b> Video card must be 256MB or more and contain these chipsets or better: NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GT ; ATI X1900.</i> <i>Laptop versions of these chipsets may work but are not supported.

The games is hosted by Mr. Potato Head, and players can use their Mii and Avatar on the Wii and Xbox', '<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Family Game Night 3 is the third in Hasbro''s Family Game series. It contains a collection of classic board games and is aimed at providing a "family" experience with generally simplified gameplay.</p><h2>Games</h2><h3>Moustrap</h3><p style="">Mousetrap is a classic board game in which players roll dice to move along a game trail. Along the way, players earn cheese tokens and the chance to build "The Con-TRAP-tion," an elaborate Rube Goldberg device. At the end of the game trail, players circle 6 spaces. One space is a large piece of cheese, another gives players an opportunity to "Spin the Wheel." If a player spins the wheel while another player is on the cheese, the contraption goes off and the trap settles over the player on the cheese, eliminating him from the game.</p><p style="">Mousetrap contains a special mini-game when players land on the "build" spaces. Players must guide a marble through certain marked pieces in a manner similar to "Pipe Dream" in order to build 1, 2, or 3 contraption pieces.</p><h3>Clue</h3><p style="">Clue is a rather old board game in which players must solve a murder mystery through the process of elimination. Players roll dice, then walk around a mansion, either interrogating suspects or starting "rumors" to guess who may have committed the crime. Once players believe they can solve the crime, the approach the pool and make a guess.</p><p style="">In this version of Clue, players may enter into specific rooms and "interrogate" suspects, this causes a section of a covered picture to be revealed to all the players. This gives a clue to either the room or the weapon involved in the crime.</p><p style="">Players may also traverse the hallways of the house, standing on "?" squares to earn "Rumor Points." Once a player fills her "Rumor Bar," she may start a rumor. This involves choosing a room, weapon, and suspect, and guessing. The results are then revealed only to the guessing player. </p><p style="">Players may randomly play one of three minigames to earn Rumor Points, otherwise the computer just awards 1, 2 or 3 rumor points. The games include choosing the green case files from a group of red ones, a timing based game involved stopping the fingerprint brush next to the green finger prints, and a "hidden picture" mini game.</p>', 8);

What sets this game apart from recent Need For Speed games is the ability to play as a police officer as well as a street racer, with full career modes for both. The racer''s career mode is all about driving really fast, racing and outrunning the cops, while the police officer''s career mode is all about chasing down the racers and busting them. The career mode for both racers and cops consists entirely of events, with no plot or story.</p><p style="">Specifically, the police officer will have to ram or otherwise damage the racer''s vehicle until its energy bar is depleted. The racer, on the other hand, will have to escape and avoid destruction. This mechanic is similar to that in the game''s predecessors, such as Most Wanted or Carbon.</p><p style="">The game is set in the fictional location <a data-ref-id="3015-2509" href="/fictional-locations-based-on-real-ones/3015-2509/">Seacrest County</a>. Players are able to race in a wide array of settings, including desert, forest, seaside and mountainous regions, both on-road and off in the form of shortcuts.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style="">While playing through the offline "Career" mode, players will unlock various events which each adhere to a specific set of rules depending on the mode.</p><h3>Police Modes</h3><ul><li><b>Hot Pursuit -</b> The player must attempt to shutdown a race in progress by wrecking the racers or using weapons against them. The number of racers, the number of "busts" required, and the weapons available change from event to event.</li><li><b>Interceptor</b> - This is a 1v1 gametype in which the cop must bust the racer before he is able to escape. The opposing racer is not limited to a track and is able to take any road in sight and may also turn around when the player least expects it. The weapons available change from event to event.</li><li><b>Rapid Response</b> - Essentially a time trial in which the player can pick from any car unlocked in the available class in an attempt to finish within a certain time.</li><li><b>Preview</b> - Another time trial variant in which the player is given a specific car and must finish within a certain time.</li></ul><h3>Racer Modes</h3><ul><li><b>Race</b> - The player must beat opposing A.I. in a flat out race where any unlocked car within the given class can be chosen. No cops are present during these races and no weapons or abilities are present.</li><li><b>Hot Pursuit</b> - The player attempts to finish the race in first place as well as surviving cop pressure. Weapons are available and vary from event to event.</li><li><b>Preview</b> - Time trial variant in which the player is given a specific car and must finish within a certain time.</li><li><b>Time trial</b> - Any car can be used within the given class and the race must be finished within a certain time.</li><li><b>Gauntlet</b> - Another time trial variant, this time with police pressure and weapons available.</li><li><b>Duel</b> - Simply a 1v1 race to the finish.</li></ul><h2>Weapons / Abilities</h2><h3>Racers</h3><p style="">The racers have different special abilities which they unlock as the race progresses, each mapped to a button on the d-pad. They include:</p><ul><li><b>Spike Strip</b> - Disables the vehicle (as it spins and comes to a complete halt) for a short while. It will also do some damage to the vehicle.</li><li><b>Jammer</b> <b>-</b> Briefly disables the GPS of opponents, will jam the HUD of the chaser, and will also prevent the Cop from calling in any help (Spikes, Heli, Road Block, EMP). In addition, the Jammer stops EMP lock ons and disables deployed Spike Strips.</li><li><b>Turbo</b> - A more powerful nitrous boost. The entire screen of the racer will warp as the player activates this ability.</li><li><b>EMP</b> - Causes long range damage, as well as slightly slowing down the opponent and affecting handling.</li></ul><h3>Cops</h3><p style="">The cop will also be able to use different special abilities to bust the racer, each mapped to a button on the d-pad. They include:</p><ul><li><b>Spike Strips</b> - Disables the vehicle (as it spins and comes to a complete halt) for a short while. It will also do some damage to the vehicle.</li><li><b>Helicopter</b> - The chopper will track down racers and thus increase the radius of the search area. It will also be able to lay down spike strips as the ability is upgraded to a higher level.</li><li><b>Road Blocks</b> - Sets up police cars to block the road ahead. If the racer or cop hits the road block they will take damage, but there is also a small area which racers may escape.</li><li><b>EMP</b> - Causes long range damage, as well as slightly slowing down the opponent and affecting handling.</li></ul><p style="">For both Racer and Cop, the abilities receive upgrades based on player progress. For example, the police chopper may not initially be able to lay down spike belts early in the game. As the player progresses, however, the chopper will be able to do such things. In addition, spike strips increase from 1 to 2 dropped at one time.</p><p style="">The majority of cars have police variants. Some cars are exclusive to racers, while some are exclusive to the police. It is also worth noting that police variants of cars available in the game are generally slightly faster than the normal ones. The handling of cars in game is also much more similar to that in the early <a data-ref-id="3025-76" href="/burnout/3025-76/">Burnout</a> series games.</p><h2>Multiplayer Modes</h2><ul><li><b>Race</b> - 8-player races, no Cops.</li><li><b>Hot Pursuit</b> - 4 Racers vs 4 Cops.</li><li><b>Interceptor</b> - 1 Racer vs 1 Cop, free-roam.</li><li><b>Most Wanted</b> - Open world Cops vs Racers. The Cops must take down a specific racer, and the racers must protect them. (via Armed &amp; Dangerous DLC)</li><li><b>Arms Race</b> - A race with weapons. (via Armed &amp; Dangerous DLC)</li></ul><p style="">The game uses bounty as a form of experience points and it is universal for both players playing as police officers and street racers. The match options will be rated according to difficulty and carry a corresponding bounty payoff.</p><h2>Autolog</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1468900" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1468900"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/95284/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The game''s multi-player mode is brought together by Autolog. Autolog lets you keep track of your friend''s times by pushing your friend''s times, telling you on which track he did the time and how much you must do to beat it. Once you''ve beaten it, your time will be pushed back to your friend''s console who''ll be able to directly try to beat your new time. It also allows you to challenge them to pursuits, where one person plays as the cop while the other plays as the fugitive who''s on the run. Autolog recommends ways to play the game depending on what the player''s friends have been doing, and keeps track of your progress as you win bounty to unlock new cars.</p><h3>iPhone App</h3><p style="">On December 15, 2010, EA released a free iPhone Autolog app. The name of the app is "Need for Speed Autolog." As of November 8, 2011 the app has 15 ratings for an average score of 3/5 stars. Features of the app include:</p><ul><li>View Wall posts</li><li>Reply to Wall posts</li><li>You can see Dreamshots taken by friends, even save them to your device</li><li>Change your profile photo</li><li>See all Autolog recommendations waiting for you in the game.</li></ul><h3>Android App</h3><p style="">A playable mobile version of the game. Features of the app include:</p><ul><li>Achievements</li></ul><p style="">Requires Android OS 2.0 or later.</p><h2>Limited Edition</h2><p style="">On August 17, 2010, it was announced that a Limited Edition of Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit would be released on all platforms (PS3, 360, PC) and will be the same price as the regular edition. It would include exclusive access to the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and the Ford Shelby GT500.

It consists of 2 events. The first accessible event is a Hot Pursuit event called Dark Horse, where Players play as a cop. They must attempt to stop 4 other A.I. racers before they reach their destination. To help with this, the player has 2 weapons at his disposal. The first is a Spike Strip that drops directly behind the player''s car. The second is a road block that is setup in front of the player. The more racers taken out before the end of the race the more bounty players receive. Bounty is a form of XP that is used to level up either the cop or the racer. Players can choose between the Nissan 370Z and the Ford Crown Victoria.</p><p style="">The second event is only accessible if the player has someone on their friends list that has also played the demo. It is a race event called Roadsters Reborn. It''s a simple point to point race with 5 other A.I. racers and no cops. The player is rewarded more bounty the better they finish. The cars to choose from are the Nissan 370Z Roadster, BMW Z4 sDrive35is and Porsche Boxster Spyder.</p><p style="">The Demo features only two songs: Pint Shot Riot''s "Nothing from You (Redenka Remix)", and 30 Seconds to Mars'' "Edge of the Earth" (which is also featured at the title screen). Both the 360 and the PS3 play game soundtrack in the Race Event only, there is no music in the Hot Pursuit event. Custom soundtracks on the PS3 and 360 are limited to saved playlists only. On the PS3, this effectively limits the player to locally-stored music, while the XBOX 360 allows for playlists saved on a media server.</p><h2>E3 2010</h2><p style="">The game was first shown during E3 2010. It was revealed during the EA press conference which opened with the game''s reveal trailer.

Full spectrum punching is said to be one of the most realistic punching systems ever designed, while still being accessible to new users.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Legacy Mode</h3><p style="">In Legacy Mode you can create a boxer, fight through the rankings to become champion, and be inducted into the boxing hall of fame. Legacy in Champion is said to be an improvement from <a href="/fight-night-round-4/3030-20452/" data-ref-id="3030-20452">Fight Night Round 4</a> with some authentic amateur gear and scoring system. Once you prove yourself and leave the amateur ranks you will earn money for your fights that will allow you to pay for trainers at different gyms around the world who will be able to teach you different things.

This means that a reckless fighter who takes a lot of punches to the head will have a much shorter career than one who is more careful and doesn''t leave himself open all the time. <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">Experience points</a> are awarded for fights. Which can be used to make a specific move (ex:Left hook) far more effective. This allows for more diversity, as some boxers can have deadly body hooks that could quickly deplete your stamina, while others would be more effective at face jabs and crosses, quickly depleting your health.</p><h3>Champion Mode</h3><p style="">Unlike Legacy mode, where you can create your own fighter and choose how his career develops and what his skills are, Champion Mode is a scripted story following the career of <a href="/andre-bishop/3005-17256/" data-ref-id="3005-17256">Andre Bishop</a>,a middle weight fighter modeled after and played by actor LaMonica Garrett.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704985-fightnightchamp_mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704985" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704985-fightnightchamp_mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704985"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1704985-fightnightchamp_mode.jpg"></a><figcaption>Andre Bishop</figcaption></figure><p style="">As <a href="/andre-bishop/3005-17256/" data-ref-id="3005-17256">Andre</a>, you are trained with your younger brother Raymond by Gus Carisi. Gus was the man who trained your father and was a promising <a href="/boxer/3015-13/" data-ref-id="3015-13">boxer</a> himself back in the day. Andre has a lot of talent and it attracts the interest of DL McQueen, a ruthless fight promoter who wants to take over Andre''s career, but Andre and Gus explicitly state that they are not interested in working with him, much to his chagrin. They are however on much better terms with McQueen''s daughter, Meagan, played by <a href="/eliza-dushku/3040-76821/" data-ref-id="3040-76821">Eliza Dushku</a>.</p><p style="">The story shows Andre Bishop''s challenges and struggles as he tries to become a great fighter. It is a linear story but the challenges play out differently depending on what your skill level is and how well you do in the ring. Champion Mode also has some special events and challenges based on the narrative of the story.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Full Spectrum Control</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1701846-x360fspc520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1701846" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1701846-x360fspc520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1701846"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1701846-x360fspc520.jpg"></a><figcaption>Full Spectrum Punch controls.</figcaption></figure><p style="">In Fight Night Round 4, the player used gestures on the right analog stick of the controller to determine the type of punch that the fighter would throw. Fight Night Champion once again uses the right stick, but as there is no more awkward motions you can throw punches more accurately and faster. These punches can then be modified by holding the either the Lean/Body Punch modifier or the newly introduced Power Punch modifier.</p><h3>Power Punch Modifier</h3><p style="">Fight Night Champion forgoes the Haymaker punch from previous games, deemed "too arcade-y", instead allowing you to put more weight behind your punch using the Heavy Punch Modifier button. The result is a more powerful punch at the expense of speed and stamina, leaving yourself open for a counter punch.</p><h3>Reflexive Boxing</h3><p style="">Each Boxer in Champion has stats for Reflexes and Blocking Strength, and both of these values will degrade over time if it is spent blocking. This means you must block efficiently and at the correct time in order to create an opportunity to respond with a more damaging counter punch. The higher the reflex the more time you have to block, even allowing boxers with high reflexes to block a split second before a punch makes contact. While a lower reflex rating will make the block take more time. A low block strength coupled with low reflexes will make slow blocks that can be easily punched through if timed wrong.</p><h3>Counter Punching</h3><p style="">Champion puts emphasis on catching your opponent off-guard after they miss, or you deflect, a punch. When timed correctly, your punch will connect with the opponent when he is at his most vulnerable, resulting in a more damaging blow. The "window of opportunity" is very small, as there is no longer a slow down when you dodge a punch. Rather you must rely on your own reflexes.</p><h2>Online Play</h2><p style="">Fight Night: Champion features online head-to-head fights, just as it''s predecessor did. Online Gyms have been added, similar to what can be found in the EA MMA game. These Gyms allow players to set up in-gym seasons and tournaments to find out who is the best. There will also be a system of gym rivalries, which will encourage fighters from one gym to box against fighters from another for points and prestige. Similar to Legacy mode players can use <a href="/experience-points/3015-39/" data-ref-id="3015-39">XP</a> from fights to put into different attributes, as well as increases to the effectiveness of certain punches. Points gained are based on the fighter''s performance.</p><h2>Roster</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704875-4814710610_e2960c7f99_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704875" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704875-4814710610_e2960c7f99_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704875"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1704875-4814710610_e2960c7f99_o.jpg"></a><figcaption>Manny Pacquiao ... not looking so good</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Miguel Cotto</li><li>Muhammad Ali</li></ul><ul><li>Manny Pacquiao</li></ul><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704989-vg_fight_1_576.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704989" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704989-vg_fight_1_576.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704989"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1704989-vg_fight_1_576.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wladimir Klitschko</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704873-fnc110c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704873" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1704873-fnc110c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704873"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1704873-fnc110c.jpg"></a><figcaption>David Haye</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Roy Jones.Jr</li><li>Ricky Hatton</li><li>George Foreman</li><li>Oscar De La Hoya</li><li>Mike Tyson</li><li>**(Young) George Foreman</li><li>Evander Holyfield</li><li>Vitali Klitschko</li><li>Wladimir Klitschko</li><li>Joe Calzaghe</li><li>Jermain Taylor</li><li>Ã‰rik Morales</li><li>Shane Mosley</li><li>Ronald Wright</li><li>Julio Cesar Chavez</li><li>Kelly Pavlik</li><li>Lennox Lewis</li><li>Fernando Vargas</li><li>James Leija</li><li>Kendall Holt</li><li>Chad Dawson</li><li>Nonito Donaire</li><li>Cristobal Arreola</li><li>Danny Jacobs</li><li>Kevin Kelley</li><li>Eddie Chambers</li><li>Anthony Mundine</li><li>Bernard Hopkins</li><li>Billy Dib</li><li>Pernell Whitaker</li><li>Carlos Monzon</li><li>Robert Guerrero</li><li>Peter Manfredo Jr.</li><li>Tim Bradley</li><li>Zab Judah</li><li>Victor Ortiz</li><li>Vinny Paz</li><li>Erislandy Lara</li><li>Roberto DurÃ¡n</li><li>Sugar Ray Leonard</li><li>Sugar Ray Robinson</li><li>Thomas Hearns</li><li>Yuriorkis Gamboa</li><li>Marvin Hagler</li><li>Jake LaMotta</li><li>David Haye</li><li>Sonny Liston</li><li>Joe Frazier</li><li>Sonny Liston</li><li>Sergio Mora</li><li>Diego Corrales</li><li>Alvin Lewis</li><li>Eric "Butterbean" Esch</li><li>Emanuel Augustus</li><li>Tommy Morrison</li></ul><p style="">**Available only through Walmart/Amazon Pre-order</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><ol><li><b>I Need A Dollar</b> - Aloe Blacc</li><li><b>The Loser Wins</b> - Atmosphere</li><li><b>Round Of Applause</b> - Black Milk</li><li><b>Old Ways</b> - Chiddy Bang</li><li><b>Meanstreak (In Three Parts)</b> - El-P</li><li><b>I''m The Best (Funky Fresh In The Flesh)</b> - Lyrics Brom</li><li><b>The Problem Is...</b> - Murs and 9th Wonder featuring Sick Jordan and Uncle Chucc</li><li><b>I Wanna Jam</b> - N.E.R.D.</li><li><b>Keep Shining</b> - Shad</li><li><b>Sinister Kid</b> - The Black Keys</li><li><b>How I Got Over</b> - The Roots</li><li><b>The Fire</b> - The Roots</li><li><b>The Fire (Orchestral Mix)</b> - The Roots</li><li><b>Intro</b> - Tinie Tempah</li><li><b>Make Your Move</b> - Thunderball featuring Mustafa Akbar</li><li><b>China</b> - Written by Khalil Abdul Rahman, Pranam Injeti and Daniel Tanenbaum.

The objective was a more dark &amp; distinctive art style, while still retaining the general tone of excessive blood &amp; gore seen in Origins &amp; Awakening. BioWare wanted the game to have its own graphical identity, and had called the graphics in past titles in the franchise "generic".</p><h3>Animations &amp; Faster Combat</h3><p style="">Combat movement and animations have also been redone to quicken the pace of combat. In Origins, when directing a character to attack the enemy, they would shuffle into place and eventually begin attacking. In DA2 when a character is ordered to attack, they would rush towards the enemy and instantly begin attacking. It is much more gory than its predecessor, allowing players to chop an enemy in half, even groups with moves like Whirlwind. The number of finishing moves in the game have been greatly expanded, now letting spellcasters get in on the action. For example: a mage blowing an Ogre into chunks with a poison spell.</p><h3>PC v/s Console Differences</h3><p style="">The gameplay on the consoles has been refined to play to the strengths of the controller. Origins saw a stark difference between the console and PC versions of the game. On the console, enemies were somewhat weaker and arrived in waves; whereas on the PC, they were far stronger and appeared all at once. BioWare is aiming for both versions of Dragon Age II to be functionally the same in terms of number of enemies and the strategies required to tackle them.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1661877-ss_011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1661877" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1661877-ss_011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1661877"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1661877-ss_011.jpg"></a><figcaption>New minimalistic UI sacrifices looks for functionality.</figcaption></figure><p style="">However, there are still differences between the PC and console versions:</p><ul><li><b>User Interface:</b> The action bar is returning for the PC version, while the console version is using a combat wheel. The icons and presentation for all platforms have been heavily modified, with emphasis on presenting clear &amp; precise information and cutting down on art overhead that slowed down Origin''s UI.</li><li><b>Overhead Camera</b>: There is an option of an adjustable overhead camera in the PC version, while the console is locked into an over the shoulder view. Isometric view isn''t returning on the PC but players pull out the camera to get a wider overview of the battlefield.</li><li><b>Auto-Attack:</b> Auto-attack is on as the default in the PC version while it is off on the console version. After assigning the controlled character an action in the PC version, it continues to automatically attack its target while waiting for the next order. On the console version, players need to constantly press the "A" or "X" button for the character to continue its basic attack. Additionally, players can also assign auto-attack through the radial menu. All non-controlled party members behave based on tactics. Mike Laidlaw <a href="http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/141/index/4827188/2" rel="nofollow">stated</a> the reason behind this decision was to give console players greater control over their targeting and improve the "feel" of auto-attack.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Character Creation</h3><p style="">Unique character origins do not make a reappearance. <a href="../../elf/92-537/" rel="nofollow">Elves</a> and <a href="../../dwarves/92-940/" rel="nofollow">Dwarves</a> are not playable races this time around, instead the player is locked into being human. Players are still allowed to customize the appearance of of their character and choose whether they''re male or female.</p><p style="">There are still only three classes in the game of which the player can choose from:</p><ul><li><b>Warrior</b> - Melee combatants, proficient with heavy armor, and 2-handed weapons or shields. Their wide range of abilities allow them to be used in defensive and/or offensive roles. Depending on the weapon in hand, they can better withstand attacks than other classes, deal area-of-effect damage<span>, crowd control</span>, or dish out significant damage to a focused target.</li><li><b>Rogue</b> - Offensive melee class with access to duel-wielding, archery, and area-of-effect debuffs. They excel at taking down individual targets. Rogues are also the only class that can detect or disarm traps, as well as pick locks.</li><li><b>Mage</b> - Magic users, who can deal the widest variety of damage to single targets or wide areas, as well as heal and buff party members. They are generally vulnerable to direct assault by enemies and must be protected by others to survive.</li></ul><p style="">All three classes now have one main attribute that determines combat prowess: strength for warriors, dexterity for rogues, and magic for mages. This differs from Origins where more than one attribute often was used to make battle calculations. The concept of <a href="../../fatigue/92-5975/" rel="nofollow">fatigue</a> has been dropped, so players just need to meet the basic requirements of an armor to equip it, without any penalty for wearing heavier protection.</p><p style="">Spell combos have been expanded to work across classes in the Cross-class Combo System. Each class has one unique status effect that some of its abilities can produce (Stagger for warriors, Disorient for rogues, and Brittle for mages). Some of the abilities of each class can exploit these effects to do extra damage to enemies so afflicted. For example, a mage can cast the Cone of Cold spell to make the targeted enemies Brittle, then a Warrior can use the ability Mighty Blow to shatter those enemies, dealing multiple times normal damage.</p><h3>Weapon Restrictions</h3><p style="">Class-based weapon restrictions is one of the biggest changes to the combat system. Mages can only use staves, rogues can only use bows and daggers and warriors can only use 2-handed weapons, medium 1-handed weapons and shields. This is a departure from Origins where even if the character did not have the talents in a particular weapon they could equip it. In addition, warriors no longer have the ability to dual wield or to use missile weapons of any kind. This was done to stress the different roles each class has in combat.</p><h3>Character Progression</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1704048-screenshot_18_warrior_vanguard_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704048" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1704048-screenshot_18_warrior_vanguard_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1704048"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1704048-screenshot_18_warrior_vanguard_p.jpg"></a><figcaption>Branching Skill Trees</figcaption></figure><p style="">Gaining experience and leveling up in Dragon Age II is very similar to Origins, where after so many experience points players gain a level and then have ability points to distribute. The biggest change is in the talent tree layout. Instead of forcing players down a linear path like Origins, the tree now branches off from base skills into a web-like shape. It allows players to pick-and-choose skills they desire without wasting points on unwanted pre-requisites. In addition to learning new skills, players can also invest points to enhance already learned spells with more damage, greater area of effect, lowered cooldown times, etc. Players are also able to invest in character specific specialization trees that provide unique skills from those related to the character''s class. </p><h3>Save Importing</h3><p style="">Dragon Age II allows players to import their saved games from Origins and its expansion pack, Awakening. Even though the Warden isn''t the main character of the game, BioWare has said that they want the player''s decisions to matter, constantly shaping Thedas with them. Choices the player made in the past, such as who was made King of Orzammar, have an effect on Dragon Age II, showing the player the consequences of their decisions.</p><h3>Crafting &amp; Inventory</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1682326-inv_isabella.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1682326" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1682326-inv_isabella.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1682326"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1682326-inv_isabella.jpg"></a><figcaption>Redesigned Companion Itemization</figcaption></figure><p style="">The crafting system has been streamlined to avoid inventory clutter. Rather than carrying hundreds of components in their backpack, players can now simply discover an ingredient source in the world to make it readily available at all crafting vendors. The more ingredients and recipes the player has found, the more items will be available for instant purchase at a crafting station.</p><p style="">The appearance of Hawke''s helm can now be toggled on/off. While Hawke''s itemization remains largely the same as Origins, the armor for party members has been redesigned. Instead of a four-piece armor set like Hawke, Hawke''s companions each wears a permanent full-body outfit that can''t be removed or changed, with the exception of a few discoverable companion-specific upgrades can be applied to each outfit. Rings, belts, amulets, and weapons are all still equally customizable for both Hawke and companions. This has the effect of making all armor pieces (like Ser Isaac''s armor DLC) exclusive only to the player character.</p><h2>Class Updates</h2><h3>Warriors</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722333-screenshot_23_warrior_groundstab_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722333" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722333-screenshot_23_warrior_groundstab_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722333"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1722333-screenshot_23_warrior_groundstab_o.jpg"></a><figcaption>A warrior finishing off a mercenary</figcaption></figure><p style="">Warriors gain a charge like ability but lose access to any bows and missile weapons. Depending on relative size, strength, and damage done, a warrior can knock a foe down with just a normal attack to stop them from rushing spellcasters. 2-Handed attacks, instead of having the ability to up damage penetration or cause massive one shot damage, focus on AoE attacks. These attacks are subject to friendly fire rules but like Origins on the consoles, friendly fire only exists on nightmare difficulty. In addition, many warrior abilities are weapon-agnostic now and can be used with either a 2-hander or 1handed/shield equipped, allowing players to change their play-style on the fly with a simple weapon switch.</p><p style=""><b>Talent Trees</b></p><ul><li><i>Weapon &amp; Shield</i> - Warriors specializing in the traditional board-and-sword combat. They hit in a smaller arc but can control the battlefield by knocking down opponents.</li><li><i>Two-Handed</i> - Two-handed weapons hit in a much wider arc and deal more damage per blow, but lose the protection of a shield.</li><li><i>Warmonger</i> - Excel at taunting enemies and gaining high aggro through stun effects.</li><li><i>Vanguard</i> - This tree focuses on an offensive build, specializing in high damage output.</li><li><i>Defender</i> - The defender tree improves the warrior''s survivability</li><li><i>Battlemaster</i> - This tree makes the warrior an effective solo combatant and also improves his or her ability to lead the group with multiple support skills.</li></ul><p style=""><b>Specializations</b></p><ul><li><i>Templar</i> - Anti-magic warriors that serve the Chantry and police the Circle of Mages</li><li><i>Reaver</i> - Reavers gain more power as they near their own death and use enemy deaths to heal themselves.</li><li><i>Berserker</i> - Berserkers are a high-risk, high-reward specialization that use rage based attacks that drain stamina.</li></ul><h3>Rogues</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722278-screenshot_53_rogue_female_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722278" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722278-screenshot_53_rogue_female_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722278"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1722278-screenshot_53_rogue_female_o.jpg"></a><figcaption>A rogue combating two Qunari</figcaption></figure><p style="">Rogues still remain the specialized individual DPS dealers, either through the use of bows or dual wielding daggers. Archery has been reworked and deal significantly more damage and fire faster. Their talents have been reworked into the rogue talents and now play a more active role in combat through cross-class combos, area of effect damage and crowd control. Every shot arrow now carries a bigger punch and can stop charging enemies with knock-back effect from normal auto-attack itself. Special arrows no longer exist and that arrow type and damage type is entirely dependent upon the bow equipped. Bows at this time can also have runes added to them.</p><p style="">Dual wielding has been changed to be restricted to only daggers. In addition the rogues talents for dual wielding have been changed to focus on only hitting individuals instead of any group attacks. Rogues now leap into combat and get immediately behind targets. Backstabbing has been removed and in its place Rogues get bonuses for critical hits which may have additional bonuses depending upon where the character is facing. It makes it easier for console players who don''t have to worry about keeping rogues behind enemies.</p><p style=""><b>Talent Trees</b></p><ul><li><i>Dual Weapon</i> - Deal more damage while dual wielding.</li><li><i>Archery</i> - Deal more damage and gain more abilities with ranged weapons.</li><li><i>Sabotage</i> - Specialize in large scale crowd control.</li><li><i>Scoundrel</i> - Blindside targets to gain unfair advantage on the battlefield and deal more damage through backstab and other abilities.</li><li><i>Subterfuge</i> - Gain the ''Stealth'' ability and evade targets to avoid damage.</li><li><i>Specialist</i> - The rogue attacks with greater speed, power and accuracy</li></ul><p style=""><b>Specializations</b></p><ul><li><i>Assassin</i> - Exploit enemy weaknesses to deal significant damage</li><li><i>Duelist</i> - Single out enemies and eliminate them swiftly.</li><li><i>Shadow</i> - Distract targets using techniques like misdirection and then deal damage on these unsuspecting foes.</li></ul><h3>Mages</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722302-screenshot_42_mage_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722302" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1722302-screenshot_42_mage_o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1722302"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1722302-screenshot_42_mage_o.jpg"></a><figcaption>A mage fighting a dragon</figcaption></figure><p style="">Mages can only equip staves, which can now be used in direct melee combat, producing fast elemental bolts. They also get special finishing animations for melee combat, like warriors and rogues. Spellcasting has been revamped; damage from talents for all classes happens immediately and then the animation starts. Even if knocked down while casting, spells will go off. The number of mage spells available has been reduced from around 80 to about 50.</p><p style=""><b>Talent Trees</b></p><ul><li><i>Arcane</i> - Equip a magical toolbox of spells for the versatile mage.</li><li><i>Spirit</i> - Dispel hostile magic and explode your foes, then drain their life force to regain your mana.</li><li><i>Elemental</i> - Gain mastery of destructive fire and frost spells.</li><li><i>Entropy</i> - Curse enemies to debilitate them and make them ripe for butchering.</li><li><i>Primal</i> - Crush enemies with rock or sunder them with lightning.</li><li><i>Creation</i> - Heal and buff your companions or inscribe glyphs to ward off enemy attack.</li></ul><p style=""><b>Specializations</b></p><ul><li><i>Blood Mage</i> - Wield blood magic to turn your opponents'' blood against them.</li><li><i>Force Mage</i> - Turn gravity into a controllable weapon.</li><li><i>Spirit Healer</i> - Gain advanced healing magics at the tradeoff of offensive magic.</li></ul><h2>Character Interaction</h2><p style=""><b>Dialogue Wheel</b></p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/1809819-1711315_wmplayer_2011_02_17_15_41_35_72_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1809819" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/1809819-1711315_wmplayer_2011_02_17_15_41_35_72_super.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1809819"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80045/1809819-1711315_wmplayer_2011_02_17_15_41_35_72_super.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dialogue Wheels with Emoticons</figcaption></figure><p style="">The listed responses have been replaced with a dialogue wheel, similar to the Mass Effect series albeit with an important addition. An icon at the center of the wheel indicates the intent of the player''s lines like investigative, flirty, violent, sarcastic, etc.</p><p style=""><b>Friends &amp; Rivals System</b></p><p style="">The approval scale from Origins has been replaced with a friends &amp; rivals system. The approval/disapproval ratings have been turned into friendship/rivalry ratings. Unlike the old system, rivalry doesn''t not necessarily translate into animosity between Hawke and the companion. They simply see the world from different point of views.</p><p style="">Certain combat &amp; romantic options are only available through a high rivalry rating, incentivizing disagreement just as much as agreement with party members. The zenith of the rivalry scale can result in a state of mutual understanding or the member leaving the party altogether.</p><h3>Romance</h3><p style="">In DA2, any character can be seduced regardless of Hawke''s gender. Romance options are:</p><ul><li>Isabela</li><li>Merrill</li><li>Anders</li><li>Fenris</li><li>Sebastian (this character is only available with <i>The Exiled Prince</i> DLC)</li></ul><h3>Gifts</h3><p style="">The gift system has also been modified to accompany the new rating system. Companions react differently to Hawke''s gift depending on their friend/rival score. Friends might approve a gift and react with gratitude, while rivals might perceive a gift as an insult and be pushed further down the rivalry scale. The total number of gift available has been reduced, however each gift now triggers a unique set of conversation with the companion.</p><h2>Major Characters</h2><h3><a href="../../hawke/94-15911/" rel="nofollow"><b>Hawke</b></a> - Protagonist</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/1809821-1664821_817px_mariangarrett_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1809821" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/1809821-1664821_817px_mariangarrett_super.png" data-ref-id="1300-1809821"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80045/1809821-1664821_817px_mariangarrett_super.png"></a><figcaption>Hawke</figcaption></figure><p style="">Hawke is a former human resident of <a href="../../lothering/95-2830/" rel="nofollow">Lothering</a>.

The existing pre-orders made before the announcement were automatically converted to a Signature Edition of the game. According the BioWare''s website, The Signature Edition includes:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17586/1561387-signature_edition_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1561387" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17586/1561387-signature_edition_p.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1561387"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17586/1561387-signature_edition_p.jpg"></a><figcaption>Signature Edition Details</figcaption></figure><ul><li>A download code for a bonus playable character (Sebastian Vael) and mission.</li><li>A downloadable version of the game''s soundtrack.</li><li>An exclusive in-game digital armory featuring multiple weapons.</li><li>Additional downloadable items.</li></ul><p style="">According to the image of the Signature Edition also available at BioWare''s website, some of the downloadable items include a staff called Apostate''s Courage, a shield named Seeker''s Bulwark, a bow called Adder of Antiva, and a sword interestingly labeled Might of Sten, referring back to a <a href="../../sten/94-11649/" rel="nofollow">party member</a> in <a href="../../dragon-age-origins/61-20738/" rel="nofollow">Dragon Age: Origins</a>.</p><h2>Criticism</h2><p style="">In contrast to previous Bioware releases such as <a href="/mass-effect-2/3030-21590/" data-ref-id="3030-21590">Mass Effect 2</a> and Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age II was met with a great deal of backlash upon its release. Points of contention stemmed from aspects such as the changes to the combat system, dungeon design, and the overall narrative. In particular, the increased speed of combat compared to Origins was seen as a negative by those that preferred the more deliberate, tactical pace of the first game, and the manner in which enemies spawned in waves added to the sense of frustration. Additionally, the general layout of dungeons is based on a cookie-cutter set of templates in which the only variation comes from which paths are open to the player.</p><p style="">As for the narrative itself, major criticisms stemmed from the notion that the game either disregards or ignores many of the player-driven events that occurred in Dragon Age: Origins despite the position put forth by Bioware that the player''s choices would matter. For example, it is possible for the player to kill <a href="/leliana/3005-11654/" data-ref-id="3005-11654">Leliana</a>, a party member in Dragon Age: Origins, but even if she dies in the player''s Origins playthrough, she reappears in Dragon Age II, alive and well. These criticisms also extended into choices made during the course of Dragon Age II; in the endgame in particular, Hawke is forced to fight and kill Orsino even if the player ultimately sides with the mages over the templars.</p><p style="">Despite these criticisms, reviews of Dragon Age II were still largely positive. On Metacritic, the game currently holds a metascore of 82 for the PC and PS3 versions and 79 for the Xbox 360 version.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1677/292724-inon_zur_headshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-292724" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1677/292724-inon_zur_headshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-292724"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1677/292724-inon_zur_headshot.jpg"></a><figcaption>Inon Zur</figcaption></figure><p style=""><a href="../../inon-zur/72-46828/" rel="nofollow">Inon Zur</a> is again composing the soundtrack, which is being mixed by Jack Joseph Puig.

In campaign mode the player has three lives and players move through multiple stages (called ''areas'' in game) in each chapter their goal is to kill every enemy on screen (you often can''t move on until this is completed), and at times a goal is set to destroy enemy structures that factor into the story and additionally, "mini-bosses" (sometimes more than one) often show up throughout any one level. The end of stages usually consist of a grand-finale battle with hordes of enemy foot soldiers and vehicles whom the player must defeat to finish the area -- while the final area in each chapter consists of a boss fight.</p><p style="">When working their way through stages, players will rack up points along the way by killing enemies along with destroying enemy structures (though the points for destroying structures aren''t awarded until the final tally after the end of the stage) and also Gears that drop from dead enemies and vehicles are to be collected that add a multiplier to the players'' score - it takes six Gears to increase the multiplier by one and the multiplier decreases when the player takes hits.</p><p style="">Gold bars can be found throughout areas and serve as the games currency to buy upgrades for the players weapons and health. Three gold bars are available to find in each area (some being hidden to different degrees) and one is available to find in each boss battle area (these are not hidden.) At the end of each area, the players score is tallied up and a medal is awarded depending on the score. Bonus points are awarded for destroyed buildings, whether or not the spark bomb was used, etc. XP is also earned and can be used to buy unlockables such as paint schemes for your Gatling Gear, and pets who follow you throughout levels.</p><h3><b>Modes</b></h3><p style="">There are two modes available, Campaign and Survival: <b>Campaign</b> can be played single player, or in co-op over Xbox Live or local multiplayer. <b>Survival</b> mode comes complete with 3 different areas where the player must protect certain structures from never-ending waves of enemies while still collecting Gears for increasing the score multiplier.

Before upgrades the gatling guns are weak, short range machine guns that work well on smaller targets, but they do not need to recharge. The cannons are good for stronger targets, mainly heavier duty enemies such as helicopters (they can kill ground troops, but only one at a time - they do not cause splash damage) though you can only fire 6 in succession before it needs to recharge (the recharge is roughly 3 seconds per cannon shot.) The grenades have an area of effect explosion, and you can pick the area where you want them to hit. There is a max of 3 grenades before you must wait for them to recharge -- which takes about 6 seconds per grenade. Additionally, the player can use one Spark Bomb per area. The Spark Bomb when used will clear the screen of all enemies and destructible structures.</p><p style=""><b>Weapon and Health upgrades</b></p><p style="">Weapon and health upgrades, as well as unlockables are purchased from the "Pirate Shop," -- which is a mobile store that is transported around by a helicopter.

CRASH! takes the popular Crash mode that was absent from the franchise''s most recent release <a data-ref-id="3030-5648" href="/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/" slug="burnout-paradise">Burnout Paradise</a> and gives it a top-down perceptive. Like in previous Burnout games, players select a nice shiny sports car, drive it to an intersection and ram it into a bunch of other cars, trucks and buses. Each vehicle that is hit or involved in an accident will earn the player points (which come in the form of dollars) and contribute to their multiplier that will keep on building as long as your car hits other vehicles. The game features 18 different courses in 6 different locations.</p><p style="">The popular social mechanic, <a data-ref-id="3015-7018" href="/autolog/3015-7018/" slug="autolog">Autolog</a> from <a data-ref-id="3030-31698" href="/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/" slug="need-for-speed-hot-pursuit">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</a>, makes its return. Burnout CRASH! also features <a data-ref-id="3015-3249" href="/kinect-support/3015-3249/" slug="kinect-support">Kinect</a> support.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Burnout CRASH! is a re-imagining of the popular Crash mode in previous Burnout games. Here the player must select a car which he controls from a top-down perspective. Levels are broken up into intersections and the main singleplayer mode is Road Trip.</p><p style="">The player must steer his car into a junction full of other cars and crash into them. The goal here is to cause as much wreckage as possible until time runs out or your car stops moving. After hitting a car, you can use aftertouch where the game goes into slow motion and you can guide the flaming carcass of what used to be your car and orient it towards potential victims. This is used to keep your multiplier going, which rises as you hit more and more cars. If your car stops moving, you can also use a crashbreaker which triggers a massive explosion and lets you move your car around again. The gameplay changes according to what type of car you take. A smaller car will be speedier but won''t cause as much damage as the minivan. Certain cars also have bonuses that can win you points. Your playing field also changes according to which track you''re playing on, which can be a regular intersection or one full of UFOs and lobster monsters. There are also bonus cars rolling through the intersection that must be avoided (like the ambulance) or hit for bonus points (the pizza truck).</p><p style="">The game also features Kinect support. You steer your car by holding your arms out in front of you as if you were driving an actual car. You''ll then control your car while it''s in aftertouch by walking around and by using gestures, like jumping, you''ll activate a crashbreaker. The idea of giving the game Kinect support originally stemmed from a hack that granted Kinect support to Burnout Paradise where you would steer with your arms and reverse by kicking back one of your feet. The game was also originally set to be released on Wii. There, you were supposed to trace with the remote which way you wanted your car to go. The Wii version was cancelled as the whole" use the remote to tell your car where to go" concept seemed boring to the developers.</p><p style="">Multiplayer is comprised of the same gameplay, with players working in teams and adding a slot machine mechanic like <a data-ref-id="3030-25042" href="/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/" slug="mortal-kombat">MK9</a>''s Test Your Luck mode, where the level, car, and gesture to activate the crashbreaker are selected at random.</p><h2>Leak</h2><p style="">Like most games that are submitted early for classification, CRASH! was revealed by the OFLC (the New Zealand video game rating board) before the game was announced by EA.</p>', 8),

The AI is also said to be ''more human''.</li><li><b>"AI Vision":</b> This new system is poised to make passing more realistic than ever before by factoring a player''s line of sight into the passing game (i.e. attempting to pass to a player behind the user controlled one is set to be extremely difficult to pull off.).</li><li><b>Enhanced AI</b>: The AI will now adapt to the game and make better choices that will help the team.</li><li><b>New Arenas &amp; Presentation:</b> Three new arenas will be featured in FIFA 12 along with a new camera and match presentation.</li><li><b>Short Dribble:</b> Flicking the left stick can cause a new short dribble. Further information is not known at this time.</li><li><b>UI Improvements:</b> A brand new, supposedly ergonomic, menu system will be in place.</li><li><b>Tactical defending:</b> This makes it possible to defend in a much more advanced way. It is now much more focused on zone defence than on tackling, and therefore allows a much more realistic defensive behaviour. Instead of holding the press button, you now have to perfectly time your tackles.</li></ul><h2>Impact Engine</h2><p style="">This new feature will change the animation of players involved in tackles and collision, from full blown sliding tackles to slight nudges of the shoulder. The Impact Engine calculates the impact of two colliding players and the animation will be rendered in real time, judging by what body parts are involved in the collision. This makes for more fluid and natural movement.</p><p style="">Also added with the impact engine is something that EA have labelled, "true injuries". Injuries in previous games have been randomised, unrealistic and been a big talking point among fans of the game who want a more real experience. True injuries uses the Impact Engine to calculate where on the body is hurt, what sort of injury it is and how bad it is. This adds in a new element into the game of players injuring themselves because of playing too many games without rest.</p><p style="">You can already get a small taste of the Impact Engine with <a href="http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/player-impact-engine-trailer-02" rel="nofollow">this trailer</a>.</p><h2>Tactical defending</h2><p style="">EA listened to the users when it came to defending gameplay which was too easy and simple for many. You could easily regain possession and tackle while holding a single key/button. Now, that is all past with a new feature which is introduced in FIFA 12, ''Tactical defending''.</p><p style="">Instead of unrealistic pressure from defenders in FIFA 11, where you just stormed at an attacker, EA have implemented <b>Contain</b>. With <b>Contain</b> the defender will follow all actions of the attacker and will keep the same distance away unless adjusted by moving the left analog stick.</p><p style="">Also gone is the auto-tackle feature: to capture the ball, you have to time your tackles, else it will fail. This will make aspects of the game such as dribbling more rewarding as you have more chance of beating your man without being easily tackled.</p><h2>Pro Player Intelligence</h2><p style="">Pro Player Intelligence is an upgrade of last year''s Personality Plus and works almost in the same way. The AI will be able to adapt and learn to cater for their individual and team needs. A small, fast team such as FC Barcelona will use their technical advantage and keep possession and keep the ball on the ground, while a more direct, counter attacking team like Tottenham Hotspur will get the ball forward quickly to taller players like Peter Crouch.</p><p style="">An example of how a player will adapt to situations is how they almost never send high crosses to smaller players because they cannot reach it because of their height and instead will choose to hit the ball low or look for more options.</p><h2>Precision Dribbling</h2><p style="">In previous FIFA instalments, EA tried to improve the dribbling of more skilled and technical players. With FIFA 12, they give dribbling a whole new face with Precision Dribbling. A quick preview of it''s functions:</p><h3>Touchline control</h3><p style="">The players will now know their surroundings for dribbling. For example, if you are very close to the touchline, the player will know it, and will do everything to avoid the ball getting out of play by keeping the ball closer to their feet, shielding the ball from the line with their foot and rescuing any balls going out of play.</p><h3>Jogging</h3><p style="">A player with ball possession will now be able to run with smaller steps. You will go slower, but you gain much more control of the ball. This is a feature implemented in previous games and triggered using the left trigger and is now being vastly improved to make it a viable solution for close control problems.</p><h3>Shielding</h3><p style="">The players will be able to shield of the ball allowing them to block other players from capturing the ball. You can now move while shielding.</p><h2>EA Sports Football Club</h2><p style="">EA Sports Football Club is the new online in-game service for the FIFA series and will be included in every FIFA from 12 onwards. The idea of Football Club is to add more depth to online play and make everyone more connected to their favourite club. When you first put FIFA 12 into your system, you will be asked what your favourite club is, or what club you want to ''support'' in EA Sports Football Club. Nearly everything you do relating to that club whether its online or off will contribute to its standings in various global and local leaderboards.</p><p style="">EA have commented on comments made by critics and fans by explaining that top clubs will not be the focus in this service and have implemented various systems to help prevent any one club having an advantage due to it''s larger an base. One example of this is that every win, loss and draw also takes into account the fan base and works out an average so every club can move up and down the leaderboard, regardless of their stature.</p><p style="">Challenges are also part of Football Club. You will be able to get challenges based on the team you support. Not much is known about how this will work but examples have been given: playing as Blackpool FC against Manchester United on the last day of the Premier League and try to survive the onslaught or trying to win cups for teams that have previously lost in the final.</p><h2>Stadiums</h2><ul><li>Akaaroa Stadium</li><li>Allianz Arena â€“ Bayern Munich</li><li>Aloha Park</li><li>Amsterdam ArenA â€“ Ajax</li><li>Anfield â€“ Liverpool</li><li>Arena Dâ€™Oro</li><li>BC Place Stadium â€“ Vancouver Whitecaps (new)</li><li>British Modern (new)</li><li>Camp Nou â€“ Barcelona</li><li>Century Park Arena</li><li>Court Lane</li><li>Crown Lane</li><li>Eastpoint Arena</li><li>El Bombastico</li><li>El Medio</li><li>El Reducto</li><li>Emirates Stadium â€“ Arsenal</li><li>Estadio Azteca â€“ Club America, Mexico</li><li>Estadio Latino</li><li>Estadio Mestalla â€“ Valencia</li><li>Estadio Preisdente G.Lopes</li><li>Estadio Vincente CalderÃ³n â€“ AtlÃ©tico de Madrid</li><li>Estadio De Las Artes</li><li>Estadio del Pueblo</li><li>Etihad Stadium â€“ Man City (new)</li><li>Euro Park</li><li>FIWC Stadium (PS3 only)</li><li>Forest Park Stadium</li><li>Imtech Arena â€“ Hamburg</li><li>Ivy Lane</li><li>Juventus Stadium â€“ Juventus (new)</li><li>O Dromo</li><li>Old Trafford â€“ Manchester United</li><li>Olimpico Arena</li><li>Olympiastadion â€“ Hertha BSC</li><li>Parc des Princes â€“ Paris Saint-Germain</li><li>Pratelstvi Arena</li><li>San Siro â€“ Inter Milan/AC Milan</li><li>Santiago BernabÃ©u â€“ Real Madrid</li><li>Signal Iduna Park â€“ Borussia Dortmund</li><li>St Jamesâ€™ Park â€“ Newcastle</li><li>Stade Gerland â€“ Olympique Lyonnais</li><li>Stade Kokoto</li><li>Stade Municipal</li><li>Stade Velodrome â€“ Olympique de Marseille</li><li>Stadio Olimpico â€“ Lazio, Roma</li><li>Stadion 23.

The game features a similar persistent multiplayer model seen in recent Battlefield games, while bringing back the overall essence and gameplay aspects of the older games of the franchise. The multiplayer''s persistence system consists of gaining experience points by killing enemies, performing supporting actions for the team and accomplishing objectives. As the player gains more XP, they go up in rank (top rank is 145), earn ribbons and medals that award them for specific actions on the battlefield, as well as unlocking better weaponry for the various kits and unlocking several weapon attachments, player gadgets/tools, performance-enhancing perks and vehicle specializations.</p><p style="">The multiplayer component features 9 maps on the disc, and five different game modes for each map (with different pacing, objectives and player count for each mode). DLC adds even more maps and game modes.</p><p style="">Health regeneration has been significantly tweaked. In Battlefield 3, where after taking damage, health regeneration is delayed for up to 20 seconds before it kicks in, and it takes a good while before reaching 100%. Furthermore, when the player is under enemy suppression, health regeneration is paused. The ability to go prone also makes a return, but is balanced by making the action a slow process, and also slowing the movement in prone position.</p><p style="">DICE''s executive producer Patrick Bach stated in an interview that they slowed down the pace of leveling up after the studio underestimated the popularity of Bad Company 2. Unlike BC2, the top ranks become an incentive and carry bonuses.</p><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="">The game modes from previous Battlefield games return, including classic Conquest and Rush and Squad Deathmatch which were introduced in the Bad Company series, with additional modes and options to choose from. Hardcore Mode returns from Bad Company 2, which is an alternative version to the "normal mode" of regular servers. Any game mode can be toggled to be Hardcore Mode, which removes a lot of the HUD elements and raises bullet damage, and any map can be selected to be infantry-only, with no attack vehicles (transport vehicles will still spawn in):</p><ul><li><a href="../../conquest-mode/92-1099/" rel="nofollow">Conquest</a> (Maximum of 32 players on PC, 24 on consoles) - The classic Battlefield game mode in which two teams scramble to maintain control of flags scattered around parts of the map. Killing enemies depletes the enemy ticket count, and controlling a majority of the flags on the map causes the enemy team to bleed tickets over time. Teams win by depleting the enemy team''s ticket count.</li><li>Conquest Large (Maximum of 64 players on PC, 24 on consoles) - Conquest mode with "Large" variants of maps, built with more flags and for more players in mind.</li><li><a href="../../assault/92-3294/" rel="nofollow">Rush</a> (Maximum of 32 players on PC, 24 on consoles) - An attack and defend game mode in which one team must defend three sets of two M-COM crates from being destroyed by the attacking team. As each set of M-COM is destroyed, the defending team is pushed further back into the map. Attacks win when all M-COMs are destroyed, and defenders win when the attacking team''s ticket amount is depleted.</li><li>Squad Rush (8 players) - A variant of Rush in which there is only one M-COM crate per map phase, and significantly less tickets, encouraging more careful gameplay and shots that count.</li><li><a href="../../team-deathmatch/92-2463/" rel="nofollow">Team Deathmatch</a> (Maximum of 32 players on PC, 24 on consoles) - Standard deathmatch mode in which two teams fight to reach a specified kill count.</li><li>Squad Deathmatch (Maximum of 16 players across all platforms) - Up to four teams of four go against each other to see who can reach the maximum kill count first. An Infantry Fighting Vehicle will spawn at random intervals during the match to shake up the battle.</li></ul><h3>Classes</h3><p style="">Battlefield 3 has four player classes (kits) to choose from in the multiplayer, which are similar to those found in <a href="../../battlefield-2142/61-17828/" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 2142</a>. Each class gets its own exclusive special equipment and gear, which consist of the Commander mode''s assets from Battlefield 2 (i.e. <a href="../../unmanned-aerial-vehicle/93-3350/" rel="nofollow">UAV</a>, artillery), in addition to brand new equipment to the franchise.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1366/1834171-mp_character_profiles_us.png" data-ref-id="1300-1834171" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1366/1834171-mp_character_profiles_us.png" data-ref-id="1300-1834171"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1366/1834171-mp_character_profiles_us.png"></a><figcaption>Class Lineup</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Assault</b> - The normal Battlefield assault class (carrying assault rifles) has been combined with the medic class and is able to heal &amp; revive teammates with medic kits &amp; <a href="../../defibrillator/93-3443/" rel="nofollow">defibrillators</a>. Should the player choose to play as assault, they can replace the med-pack with an underslung <a href="../../grenade-launcher/93-252/" rel="nofollow">grenade launcher</a> on their assault rifle. According to senior multiplayer designer Lars Gustavsson,</li></ul><blockquote><p style="">"The reason for this class fusion is because the assault class serves at the frontlines, so it only makes sense to give those frontline players the ability to revive downed teammates".</p></blockquote><ul><li><b>Engineer</b> - This class carries carbines &amp; anti-vehicle rocket launchers. They are able to repair vehicles with a <a href="../../repair-tool/93-4993/" rel="nofollow">repair torch</a>, or can remotely arm and disarm MCOMs with a Explosive Ordinance Disposal robot (EOD bot). Anti-tank mines can replace the repair torch.</li><li><b>Support</b> - This class carries <a href="/light-machine-gun/3055-1808/" data-ref-id="3055-1808">light machine guns</a> (LMG), and has the ability to mount their LMG using the bipod on the front of the gun for better accuracy. They have the ability to throw out <a href="../../ammo-box/93-184/" rel="nofollow">ammo packs</a> to resupply teammates, and also have access to explosives such as <a href="../../c4/93-896/" rel="nofollow">C4</a>, Claymores, and mortars. An effective support player can help drive the Assault players forward with more ammunition and mortar fire to suppress the enemy.</li><li><b>Recon</b> - This class is equipped with long range <a href="/sniper-rifle/3055-67/" data-ref-id="3055-67">sniper rifles</a>, in addition to other reconnaissance equipment such as motion sensors and <a href="/micro-air-vehicle/3055-5516/" data-ref-id="3055-5516">Micro Air Vehicles</a> (MAV). Rifle sway has been added to the game, forcing snipers to actively <a href="../../holding-your-breath/92-5281/" rel="nofollow">hold their breath</a> before taking a shot for the best accuracy, and can be augmented with bipods. Quick scoping will be much more inaccurate. An addition to this class is a radio beacon that the player can drop and acts as an additional spawn point for their squadmates to use. In order to counter snipers who lay down in the grass (prone position), a new feature has been added where if the player lays in the grass for too long, a glint will appear on their sniper rifle scope (sun reflection), giving away their position. This forces them to not camp but rather stay on the move.</li></ul><h3>Squads</h3><p style="">Though DICE decided to remove the chain of command from the game''s multiplayer (used in Battlefield 2- A commander and squad leaders), in order to achieve their new design philosophy "Lowering the threshold, making the game easy to play, hard to master", the squad leader position has returned to the game. Every squad consists of four players max (as seen in Bad Company 2), one of whom is the squad leader (the person who created the squad). All squad members can spawn on each other. The squad leader has a star by his name and over his head in-game, indicating that he''s a squad leader. Squad leaders are able to set attack/defend orders on objectives which give bonus points to squad members who follow these orders.</p><h3>Dog Tags</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/1879248-bf3_dog_tag_620x4__48.png" data-ref-id="1300-1879248" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/1879248-bf3_dog_tag_620x4__48.png" data-ref-id="1300-1879248"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/1879248-bf3_dog_tag_620x4__48.png"></a></figure><p style=""><a href="/dog-tag/3055-1235/" data-ref-id="3055-1235">Dog Tags</a> return in BF3, though their usage has changed slightly. The tags are collectable by stabbing another player, but can be customized with a variety of different pieces of information, such as a player''s total number of kills with assault rifles and so on. Some collectables are also limited in their availability, due to pre-order offers or other promotional items. Certain tags were limited only to certain retailers, such as Amazon, and some tags are given only to those who have registered on the Battlefield Veteran program and verified they have played previous games in the series.</p><h3>New Additions</h3><h4>Suppressive Fire</h4><p style="">Battlefield 3 features a new multiplayer combat mechanic called Suppressive Fire. When someone takes heavy fire, their vision will become blurred and their accuracy will decrease. A single shot from a sniper rifle will instantly suppress an enemy as it whizzes by their head due to its size and power.</p><p style="">Using Suppressive Fire, players can earn "Suppression Assists" worth 50 points which are gained when an enemy they suppressed is killed by a teammate. LMGs are particularly effective at earning Suppression Assists due to their firepower.</p><h4>Bipods</h4><p style="">Another new mechanic in Battlefield 3 is the ability to use bipods on weapons. This provides added stability for the gun, decreasing kick and recoil, and increasing accuracy. Deploying a sniper rifle on a bipod eliminates scope sway. Bipods can be deployed anywhere while the player is prone or when in front of certain objects, such as a window sill or cement barricade. The Bipod is available for all weapons except for PDWs and shotguns.</p><h4>Battlelog</h4><p style="">The game launched with a social networking website called <a href="../../battlelog/92-7019/" rel="nofollow">Battlelog</a>, which will serve as the game''s only menu and server browser, featuring extensive stat tracking, instant messaging, and an activity feed. Everything you do on the battlefield is shared on your wall amongst your friends, and (like most current social network apps) players can "like", comment, and post messages.</p><h3>Game Servers</h3><p style="">Much like past Battlefield titles, Battlefield 3 has strong dedicated server support, where anyone can rent and operate their own server. According to KM Troedsson, Battlefield 3 did not ship with LAN support for security reasons.</p><p style="">Battlefield 3 supports both ranked and unranked servers. Renting a ranked server gives you the restricted freedom to set the game map/mode etc. since Ranked servers will track player progression EAs master servers (much like in past Battlefield games). Whereas renting an unranked server gives the owners/administrators a lot more freedom to do as they will with their servers, allowing them to select specific things such as which weapons are available to players etc. The unranked server option is suited for tournaments because everyone has a level playing field (no ranks/unlocks). You cannot rank up or unlock new weapons on unranked servers.</p><p style="">According to DICE''s <a href="/mikael-kalms/3040-54455/" data-ref-id="3040-54455">Mikael Kalms</a>, renting servers is not be available in every country in the world, because the servers will be provided by select Ranked Server Providers (RSPs) around the world. Since Battlefield 3 requires more processor power per player than Bad Company 2, the pricing for server rental is higher for Battlefield 3. Unlike Battlefield 2, players aren''t able to create their own servers running on their own machines.</p><h3>Battlefield Premium</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2259582-battlefield_3_premium.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259582" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2259582-battlefield_3_premium.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2259582"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/2259582-battlefield_3_premium.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">As of early June 2012, Battlefield Premium has become available for purchase for all owners of Battlefield 3. For a single one-time fee, players gain access to all of the existing and scheduled-to-launch DLC expansions with a 2 week early access period. In addition, Premium members gain access to exclusive cosmetic in-game items such as unique dogtags, gun and soldier camouflages, and a new type of knife. DICE also announced additional perks for Premium players, such as exclusive strategy guides, videos and Battlefield-themed events such as Double XP Weekends.</p><h2>Multiplayer Maps</h2><p style="">Battlefield 3 launched with 9 multiplayer maps, taken from settings in the single player campaign, which are set in France and Iran.

The middle of the map consists of narrow alleyways creating choke points.</td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150525-grand_bazzar_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150525" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150525-grand_bazzar_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150525"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2150525-grand_bazzar_conquest_64.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td>Tehran Highway</td><td>Tehran Highway is the only night map in the core game, taking place along a stretch of the highway in the Iranian capital of Tehran. The map focuses on blending infantry and vehicular combat. The map is well known due to the relatively easy nature of ''spawn trapping'' in Conquest, since the linearity of points A and C to their initial spawns make player movements highly predictable.</td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150531-tehran_highway_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150531" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150531-tehran_highway_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150531"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2150531-tehran_highway_conquest_64.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td>Kharg Island</td><td>Kharg Island takes place in and around a seaport. Being a vehicular-based map, tanks and air support will make many appearances. Infantry can take refuge in the few buildings or behind many shipping containers around the objectives.</td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150526-kharg_island_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150526" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150526-kharg_island_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150526"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2150526-kharg_island_conquest_64.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td>Damavand Peak</td><td>Damavand Peak takes place in and around a mining operation near an Iranian mountain range. The conquest map is centred around the narrow tunnel creating a choke point. The rush map has one team pushing down the mountain towards the mining area and the tunnel from the conquest map.</td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150524-dramavand_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150524" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150524-dramavand_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150524"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2150524-dramavand_conquest_64.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr><tr><td>Noshahr Canals</td><td>Noshahr Canal begins with the American team on an aircraft carrier, and the Russian team at a gas station during Conquest. Each area of the map is varied in its design, with the teams having to make their way to each of the different points using a variety of vehicles. Jets appear on this map along with the AA gun on the aircraft carrier supposedly only spawning on the PC version of the game. An area of shipping containers makes a shotgun''s paradise, with enemies rushing to the next flag becoming prime targets in the urban jungle of the crates.</td><td><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150527-noshahr_canals_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150527" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22269/2150527-noshahr_canals_conquest_64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2150527"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22269/2150527-noshahr_canals_conquest_64.jpg"></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Weapons, Items &amp; Customization</h2><h3>Weapons</h3><p style="">In Battlefield 3, the weapons are divided into 5 groups:</p><ul><li><b>Class &amp; team exclusive weapons</b>: Weapon exclusivity for the default primary in each class is only fixed until a certain amount of XP is earned using that class.

The game''s release date was November 17th 2011, and marks the first time that the <a href="/need-for-speed/3025-483/" data-ref-id="3025-483">Need for Speed franchise</a> will offer on-foot sequences in a story driven environment. This is helped along by the engine the game runs on; <a href="/ea-digital-illusions-ce/3010-4880/" data-ref-id="3010-4880">DICE</a>''s <a href="/frostbite-2-0/3015-7846/" data-ref-id="3015-7846">Frostbite 2.0</a>, which also powers <a href="/battlefield-3/3030-27006/" data-ref-id="3030-27006">Battlefield 3</a>.</p><p style="">The concept behind the game is similar to the Gumball Rally, being an illicit street-race running across the <a href="/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/" data-ref-id="3035-396">United States</a> with competition coming from law enforcement. The game takes this further though, expanding upon the protagonist and his reason for being involved in the illegal races.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style="">Need for Speed: The Run has a prominent story mode dubbed "The Run". The player takes on the role of Jack, a man who owes too much money to the mob, money that he knows he won''t be able to pay. The player must take Jack through a cross country race from San Francisco to New York in hopes of winning money that will get him out of debt.</p><p style="">The game opens with Jack knocked unconscious in a red Porsche that''s being lowered into a car crusher. The mob have put him there, wishing to permanently end his racing career, as he owes them too much money. Jack wakes up in time and manages to escape the mob and meet with his lady friend (voiced by Christina Hendricks) who offers to help him get out of debt by partaking in a cross country race where the winner takes home 25 000 000 dollars, more than enough to pay off the mob. Jack naturally accepts, is hooked up with a fast car and proceeds to escape San Francisco just as the cops close the city down.</p><p style="">The story is then told through cut scenes and quick time events. Jack has to be in a particular position in the race by the time he reaches particular cities. He has to be in 150th place by the time he reaches Vegas, 50th by the time he reaches Chicago and (naturally) 1st by the time he reaches New York City. Naturally, he makes all of these objectives. During the trip, he faces off against certain characters such as a boxer who''s put all his money into the race, a model and her childhood friend who''s just in the race for the thrills, a family man who needs the money for his family (he races with his crew) and finally the mob, who constantly chases him throughout the game.</p><p style="">The story climaxes in New York, where Jack defeats the mob and comes in first, giving the mob its money. Despite winning the race, Jack decides to take part in yet another one and the game ends.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Like <a href="/need-for-speed-undercover/3030-20741/" data-ref-id="3030-20741">Need for Speed: Undercover</a>, Need for Speed: The Run has an in depth story about a driver par taking in a high stakes, illicit cross country race from <a href="/san-francisco/3035-191/" data-ref-id="3035-191">San Francisco</a> to <a href="/new-york/3035-3656/" data-ref-id="3035-3656">New York</a> while being chased by the police and the mob.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1804749-bigimage__8_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1804749" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1804749-bigimage__8_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1804749"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39947/1804749-bigimage__8_.jpg"></a><figcaption>An example of an on foot sequence.</figcaption></figure><p style="">The game is the first in the NFS franchise to include on foot sequences. However, the game doesn''t give you full control of your character''s movements, instead the on foot sequences are quick time events that resemble the ones found in <a href="/heavy-rain/3030-21304/" data-ref-id="3030-21304">Heavy Rain</a>. The game asks you to press multiple face buttons at a time and if you fail, the scene keeps on going, giving you chances to redeem yourself. An early example of this can be found in a on foot chase sequence in <a href="/chicago/3035-293/" data-ref-id="3035-293">Chicago</a>. If you miss a button prompt, the police officer you are fighting with will put you into a choke hold, though you can escape this by pressing a button rapidly. Obviously though, due to the game''s nature, races are also included as the core behind the gameplay.</p><p style="">Driving in the game is designed in a cinematic fashion, meaning the camera angle will be set-up to work with the events on-screen as well. In the demo an example of this came during the event involving the avalanche, where the camera was positioned to capitalize upon the avalanche''s graphical design stemming from the Frostbite 2.0 engine, which is well known due to its highly-detailed destruction and graphical capabilities.</p><p style=""><a href="/autolog/3015-7018/" data-ref-id="3015-7018">Autolog</a> makes its return in The Run, letting you compare times with your friends and sending you messages when a friend has beaten you. It also shows you in real time during a race how you''re doing compared to your friends.This leaves players, theoretically at least, in constant competition with their friends as much as with the AI.</p><h2>Car List</h2><p style=""><u><b>Aston Martin</b></u></p><ul><li><a href="http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/5/56686/1969936-aston_vantage_wm940.jpg" rel="nofollow">V12

The game was developed at <a data-ref-id="3010-422" href="/ea-tiburon/3010-422/" slug="ea-tiburon">EA Tiburon</a>, the studio most commonly associated with the <a data-ref-id="3025-491" href="/madden-nfl/3025-491/" slug="madden-nfl">Madden NFL</a> series of games.</p><p style="">Blitz runs on an updated version of the Madden engine that, unlike EA simulation franchise, runs at 60 frames per second and has a new collision system. It plays fast and loose with the rules of football, eliminating penalties that allow players to knock down receivers as soon as a play starts, potentially busting up the play.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">The game features 7-on-7 gameplay, with up to 2 cooperative players controlling each team, both online and off. Each quarter is two minutes long and players will have to go thirty yards to get a first down. During gameplay announcers <a data-ref-id="3040-50068" href="/tim-kitzrow/3040-50068/" slug="tim-kitzrow">Tim Kitzrow</a> (of <a data-ref-id="3025-1009" href="/nba-jam/3025-1009/" slug="nba-jam">NBA Jam</a>/ <a data-ref-id="3025-477" href="/nfl-blitz/3025-477/" slug="nfl-blitz">NFL Blitz</a> fame) and actor Brian Haley will do color commentary on the match-ups.</p><p style="">The main content in Blitz is made up of the following game modes:</p><h3>Play Now</h3><p style="">A local match mode where 1-4 players can play as any NFL team and fight with the computer or each other.</p><h3>Blitz Gauntlet</h3><p style="">Blitz Gantlet is a fairly straightforward arcade mode, takes you through a series of increasingly challenging games against teams varying from real NFL teams to "Fantasy Team Bosses". Up to 12 Boss characters/teams can be unlocked for use as player skins upon defeating them, and include:</p><ul><li>Horse</li><li>Zombie</li><li>Cheesehead</li><li>Robot</li><li>Clown</li><li>Hotdog</li><li>Pirate</li><li>Gladiator</li><li>Ninja</li><li>Sasquatch</li><li>Lion</li></ul><p style="">NFL Blitz Designer Yuri Bialoskursky also <a href="http://www.ea.com/nfl-blitz/blog/nfl-blitz-gauntlet" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> that they wanted to include Viking, an Alien, an FBI Agent and even President Obama, but they were cut from the final product.</p><h3>Blitz Battles</h3><p style="">Essentially a standard online ranked match mode. One player can choose any professional NFL team and be ranked on their performance locally (by US State/Territory), regionally and nationally. Two players can also get together to make their own personal team to battle other co-op teams on the leaderboards. Blitz Bucks can be earned in this mode.</p><h3>Elite League</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2061617-nflblitzjennings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2061617" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2061617-nflblitzjennings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2061617"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/2061617-nflblitzjennings.jpg"></a><figcaption>He''s on fire!</figcaption></figure><p style="">Elite League features a card collecting twist on typical career modes, a trait it borrows from recent entries in the Madden NFL and <a data-ref-id="3025-609" href="/fifa/3025-609/" slug="fifa">FIFA</a> franchises. After starting with a small deck of cards representing various NFL players and a team logo/name of your choosing, you will be able to expand your team''s lineup by spending in-game currency called "Blitz Bucks" on booster packs to find new characters and expand your team''s capabilities.</p><p style="">Blitz Bucks can only be earned by playing matches online, with a more points awarded if the players finish their game without quitting mid-match, and even more to the player who has the higher stats and score at the end of the match.</p><p style="">Standard cards require you to "update" their contracts after enough usage. There are greater rewards for completionists: for collecting all cards from a single NFL team in your deck, you will receive a "Pro" version of that team''s best player with a couple of maxed-out stats and an infinite contract length. The substantially better version of this perk comes from collecting the cards of an entire NFL division in your deck, yielding an "Ultimate Player" with all stats maxed out as well as an infinite contract.</p><p style="">The team you develop will take you through your Elite League career, and can be used in all other modes, including online match-ups with your friends or random players and even the Blitz Gauntlet mode. Players will be able bet cards against each other in online matches called "Risk and Reward" matches.</p><h3>Online Co-Op</h3><p style="">Similar to "Blitz Battles," except the matches are unranked and winning or losing will not help or hurt you on any leaderboards. However, you can still earn Blitz Bucks in this mode.</p><h2>Late Hits</h2><p style="">Late hits were originally planned to be placed in the game, but officials from the NFL objected to their inclusion after seeing an early build of the game. The developers responded by locking all player controls after the whistle blows until the next play is set.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Several play formations from the first two incarnations of the game-- <a data-ref-id="3030-8417" href="/nfl-blitz/3030-8417/" slug="nfl-blitz">NFL Blitz</a> and <a data-ref-id="3030-20653" href="/nfl-blitz-99/3030-20653/" slug="nfl-blitz-99">NFL Blitz 99</a>--appear in the new game.</li></ul><ul><li>It was announced at the 2011 <a data-ref-id="3015-5557" href="/spike-video-game-awards/3015-5557/" slug="spike-video-game-awards">VGAs</a>, that Ray Rice of the <a data-ref-id="3015-2360" href="/baltimore-ravens/3015-2360/" slug="baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> will grace the cover of NFL Blitz.</li></ul><ul><li>There are over 100 cheats you can buy using blitz bucks to change the look of the game.</li></ul>', 8);

His abilities are as follows:</p><h4>Movement</h4><p style="">By moving the left analog stick, Zero can move around the facility with style.</p><h4>Warp</h4><p style="">As Zero moves, a small orange reticule will appear 4 feet in front of him. By using his warp ability, he will leap through space to that point, ignoring all obstacles in his path. Warp can be upgraded allowing Zero to warp into <a data-ref-id="3055-82" href="/barrel/3055-82/" slug="barrel">barrels</a>, <a data-ref-id="3055-43" href="/turret/3055-43/" slug="turret">turrets</a>, and even humans.</p><h4>Frag</h4><p style="">Wiggling the left analog stick while inside an object or person will cause it to explode, destroying the object and creating a small shockwave that will knock down nearby enemies. This can create quite a mess.</p><p style="">The player can choose not to frag Zero''s foes by instead <a data-ref-id="3015-1577" href="/stun/3015-1577/" slug="stun">stunning</a> them; warping in and out of an enemy will stun them for a short while, but warping in, shaking up the person a little bit, and then leaping out will cause a longer lasting stun knockdown.</p><h4>Echo</h4><p style="">Zero can deploy a fantom <a data-ref-id="3015-6116" href="/decoy/3015-6116/" slug="decoy">decoy</a> of himself that can walk through walls. Humans and robots will not be able to tell the difference between an echo and the real thing. This can be used to lure them to other locations or to make them shoot at objects nearby. If Zero is inside an object while creating the echo, it will take on the form of the object. Robots will be tricked into not shooting the shaped echo, but humans will be more discerning of objects that don''t act in the way they normally should.</p><h4>Swap</h4><p style="">By touching his echo to an object, Zero can swap places with it. If Zero is already in an object before swapping, that object will explode out in a swap frag.</p><h4>Launch</h4><p style="">Zero can launch objects he is inside of in any direction, stunning enemies and destroying electrical panels.</p><h3>Passive Abilities</h3><p style="">In addition to the active abilities Zero can also upgrade several passive ones that indirectly benefit the player in traversing the lab.</p><h4><b>Fast Recovery</b></h4><p style="">Helps Zero recover from getting stunned by water, stun-mines or water-shields faster.</p><h4><b>Show Grubs</b></h4><p style="">Displays all the grubs as purple icons on your map. Even areas that you have not visited yet will have grubs visible, albeit floating on a black background.</p><h4><b>Show Canisters</b></h4><p style="">Same ability as Show Grubs except that film canisters are highlighted on the map screen.</p><h4>Silent Warp</h4><p style="">Makes warping inaudible to scientists and guards alike helping you sneak by and surprise enemies easier. If you did not purchase the silent movement upgrade it is possible to silently sneak past guards by just using the right analog to warp through a room without "walking" at all.</p><h4>Fast Warp</h4><p style="">Increases the recharge rate of your core warp ability allowing Zero to continously warp at a faster pace when on foot.</p><h4>Silent Movement</h4><p style="">Running on foot becomes completely silent to all enemies. Helpful in sneaking up behind guards with only forward facing shields.</p><h4>Fast Movement</h4><p style="">Increases core running speed. Especially helpful in latter areas of the game where motion-stun mines are introduced.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p style="">Scattered throughout the facility are <a data-ref-id="3015-1925" href="/challenges/3015-1925/" slug="challenges">challenge</a> computers that Zero can warp into, allowing him to escape reality and test his skill in various dangerous mazes.

Progress made in the campaign can improve the overall mission for players of Mass Effect 3.', '<h2>Overview</h2><p style="">Mass Effect: Infiltrator is the second cross platform promotional game made by Iron Monkey Studios, the first being <a href="/dead-space/3030-33999/" data-ref-id="3030-33999">Dead Space</a>. Telling the story of Randall Ezno, a Cerberus operative who rebels from his employer when he learns what they are really up to, Mass Effect: Infiltrator features a tie-in to <a href="/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/" data-ref-id="3030-29935">Mass Effect 3</a> by delivering intel that drops from enemies that will improve the galactic readiness meter. There are Paragon/Renegade choices in the game, as well as a truncated version of the upgrade trees from the console versions. Infiltrator released on both the iPhone and iPad in March for $6.99. The Android version was released later in May, also for $6.99.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style="">Gameplay consists of combat, a rating system, a morality system, and an upgrade system which is implemented in the form on an in-game store.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p style="">Combat tries to emulate the third-person shooter style found in the other Mass Effect games. The controls are two touch "joysticks" that allow the player to move like in any other third-person shooter. When enemies are present and in range blue brackets appear around them and tapping that enemies will cause Enzo to begin firing at them, while the player hones in on more vulnerable body parts. There are four weapons - an assault rifle, shotgun, sniper, and beam rifle. Additionally, four biotics power also help make combat easier, as well as more interesting - lift, leash, storm, and salvo. Of course enemies fire back and death puts the player back at the last checkpoint. In order to achieve maximum style rating players must use a variety of different methods to dispatch enemies and using the same weapon to kill consecutive enemies actually decreases style points.</p><h3>Rating System</h3><p style="">At the end of each combat scenario, a rating is given which determines how many credits Randall receives. Three different ratings - health, style, and time - feed into the overall rating. Each subcategory is rated out of three stars and players are then given either a rookie, soldier, or veteran rating for the checkpoint as a whole. You receive substantially more credits for higher ratings.</p><h3>Morality</h3><p style="">As is typical with the Mass Effect series, Infiltrator includes a morality system, although it is far less robust than in any other game, even the prior iOS game, <a href="/mass-effect-galaxy/3030-26087/" data-ref-id="3030-26087">Mass Effect Galaxy</a>. While moving through the Cerberus base players will encounter Cerberus scientists which can be executed (Renegade), or set free (Paragon). A final morality choice is also given. If these aspects play into player progression or story it is not clear how.</p><h3>Upgrade Store</h3><p style="">Every aspect of Randall''s loadout can be upgraded. Spending credits earned from the rating system can upgrade and purchase new weapons, biotic abilities, melee attacks, armor, etc. Most items have a four tier upgrade with costs escalating from the initial 500 credit purchase to 5000 credits. Upgrades can make the game significantly easier and more enjoyable, so grinding checkpoints for more credits can be very worthwhile. If the player doesn''t want to use their intel for Galactic Readiness, they can also cash them in for a very small amount of credits. The in-game store also includes the ability to purchase more credits with real money, or buy a credit enhancer which double the amount of credits received from that point forward.</p><h2>Galaxy at War Tie-in</h2><p style="">Mass Effect: Infiltrator also includes a bonus in that it can help to raise a players Galaxy at War rating. Galactic Readiness plays into the ending that players receive in <a href="/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/" data-ref-id="3030-29935">Mass Effect 3</a> and can be improved by either playing the multiplayer, using the Mass Effect Datapad app, or playing this game. Enemies will randomly drop pieces of intel, which can then uploaded into Galaxy at War through the in-game store. Each piece of intel translates into a little more than a 1% increase in a given theater of battle. The game can be replayed and more intel is available each time, so the potential affect is essentially limitless as long as the player is willing to grind it out.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p style="">The Android version of the game includes a free live wallpaper with the game</p>', 8);

Mass Effect 3 combines the large number of weapons, upgradable weapon statistics, and <a href="/weapon-modification/3015-2624/" data-ref-id="3015-2624">weapon modifications</a> from the original Mass Effect with the "thermal cooling" <a href="/ammo/3055-533/" data-ref-id="3055-533">ammunition</a> system of Mass Effect 2. Weapons are split up into the following categories: <a href="/assault-rifle/3055-413/" data-ref-id="3055-413">Assault Rifles</a>, <a href="/sniper-rifle/3055-67/" data-ref-id="3055-67">Sniper Rifles</a>, <a href="/pistol/3055-59/" data-ref-id="3055-59">Heavy Pistols</a>, <a href="/shotgun/3055-114/" data-ref-id="3055-114">Shotguns</a>, and <a href="/submachine-gun/3055-766/" data-ref-id="3055-766">Submachine Guns</a>.</p><p style="" data-right-indent="0" data-left-indent="0">In the predecessor games, the player''s class determines what guns they are able to use. While this still holds true to single-player squadmates, Commander Shepard (as well as multiplayer characters) can hold, at most, one of each category of weapon (no matter which class or experience level he/she is). However, weapons now have a Weight attribute. Players carrying a heavy payload of weapons have a penalty to the recharge time of the player''s active powers (up to double the standard r', 8);

The new system augments every animation in the game based on momentum and the laws of physics.

If you choose to play as a created player you choose what position you play as well as which team you will be on. Then you design your player and decide the backstory of your player. There are three options for backstory; High Draft Pick, Low Draft Pick, or Undrafted. Your backstory determines your starting ratings along with the goals you will be expected to complete in a year. As you complete goals throughout the year you earn XP which you spend to make your player''s rating better.</p><h4>Coach</h4><p style="">As a coach you can also play as a created coach, active NFL coach, or a NFL Legend. The gameplay as a coach is almost identical to last years online franchise mode. The main difference between playing as a coach or player is that the XP you earn doesn''t go directly to a rating. Instead the XP is spent on "Packages" that can do anything from make it easier to sign a player off free agency to extending the time a player keeps playing before retiring.</p>', 8),

Voting took place online at <a href="http://covervote.nhl.com/" rel="nofollow">covervote.nhl.com</a>. The official cover athlete was revealed on June 20th, 2012 at the 2012 NHL Awards in <a data-ref-id="3035-78" href="/las-vegas/3035-78/" slug="las-vegas">Las Vegas, Nevada.</a></p><p style="">It was announced at the <a data-ref-id="3025-590" href="/nhl/3025-590/" slug="nhl">NHL</a> Awards that the voting had come down to forward Claude Giroux of the <a data-ref-id="3015-5092" href="/philadelphia-flyers/3015-5092/" slug="philadelphia-flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> and goalie Pekka Rinne of the <a data-ref-id="3015-5095" href="/nashville-predators/3015-5095/" slug="nashville-predators">Nashville Predators</a>. Claude Giroux was named the winner of the contest.</p><h2>True Performance Skating</h2><p style="">NHL 13 is driven by real-world physics and a new skating engine. More than 1,000 new game play animations have been added to help authentically replicate the explosiveness, momentum, and top-end speed of today''s NHL players.</p><p style="">Skating has been altered as well to allow players the opportunity to switch to backwards skating with the push of a button. This will allow smoother transitions when trying to get shots off in the offensive zone.</p><p style="">NHL 13 will also implement a "chop" feature which will allow players to hack at their opponents when they have the puck in order to gain puck possession from them.</p><h2>EA SPORTS Hockey IQ</h2><p style="">NHL 13 features a completely overhauled A.I. and logic. NHL 13 players are now fully aware of each other on the ice. Players are smarter and quicker at making more true-to-life hockey decisions. Hockey IQ also adds a layer customization to strategies never seen before in the NHL series.</p><h2>Updated Trading System</h2><p style="">The trading block has been revamped for NHL 13. You will now be able to specifically explain to other teams just what exactly you are looking for. In past games you only had a few options to describe what you were looking for including athleticism and defense. Teams will now look at where they are currently in the standings to see what exactly their team needs to make the next move. If a team is near the bottom, they will attempt to now sell off veterans for draft picks. However, if that team makes a run near the end of the season and gets better, the AI will now try and trade for a player that will help them rather than continue to dump off salary. Teams will continuously look at their roster throughout the season and alter what type of team they are.</p><p style="">Searching for possible players to trade for has also received an upgrade. You can now let teams know exactly what you''re looking for. For example, you can indicate that you need a sniper or scorer between a certain age range as well. The game will also search for the type of players you''d like and offer examples of possible trading partners.</p><h2>Improved Goalies</h2><p style="">NHL 13 now features improved goalies. They now will anticipate plays and "cheat" in certain situations. Each limb of the goalies can now move during save animations at a moments notice. Several new goalie animations have been added.</p><h2>GM Connected</h2><p style="">NHL 13 general manager mode goes online allowing users to manage, play, or coach with and against friends in their own 30 team human controlled league.</p><p style="">GM Connected can be played in a variety of ways.</p><ol><li><u><b>Against the CPU</b></u> - this is no different then the typical NHL Be a GM Mode of the past for those that like to play independently and against the CPU.</li><li><u><b>Against each other</b></u> - GM Connected allows for up to 750 players to play in one single league.

Mac versions are currently slated for release during Spring 2013.</p><p style="">As its predecessors, the game puts the player in control of planning, building, and maintaining a simulated city. As the mayor of a virtual city, the player is given information and statistics regarding pollution, public happiness, crime rates, water levels, etc., to help make decisions about how to build and run the city. The player''s responsibilities include laying roads, setting zoning, controlling the power and water supply, managing public services like education and health, setting taxes, managing sewerage and waste, trading supplies with neighboring cities, and more.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2437350" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70212/2437350-0000000000-0000-.jpg" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70212/2437350-0000000000-0000-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2437350"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70212/2437350-6110732574-1538-.jpg"></a><figcaption>An example of zoning from SimCity 3000</figcaption></figure><p style="">After a 10 year hiatus since <a href="/simcity-4/3030-4736/" data-ref-id="3030-4736" data-mce-href="/simcity-4/3030-4736/">SimCity 4</a>, the previous major installment in the franchise, developer <a href="/maxis-software/3010-205/" data-ref-id="3010-205" data-mce-href="/maxis-software/3010-205/">Maxis</a> underwent a lengthy development cycle to create a complete, layered SimCity experience. As the name implies, SimCity is presented as a <a href="/same-name-reboot/3015-6524/" data-ref-id="3015-6524" data-mce-href="/same-name-reboot/3015-6524/">reboot</a> of sorts for the series; while it doesn''t necessarily reinvent the game entirely, many of the systems have been re-imagined and streamlined.</p><p style="">One major change is to zoning. In previous games in the series, the player could only lay down squares of residential, commercial, and industrial zones in low, medium, and high density varieties. In SimCity, the player assigns residential, commercial, or industrial zones along roads rather than in a grid. Zones will gradually become more dense over time as demand rises. Whereas zoning in previous games would require spending <a href="/simoleons/3055-5299/" data-ref-id="3055-5299" data-mce-href="/simoleons/3055-5299/">simoleons</a>, zoning is free in SimCity.</p><p style="">Maxis has also streamlined how resources, such as power, water, and sewage, are propagated through cities. The player no longer has to manually lay underground pipes and power lines, instead, resources in SimCity flow through roads. Because roads now carry all the resources in and out of the city, road design is even more important, and as such roads are also more costly.</p><p style="">All cities and regions within SimCity are saved on EA''s central servers, requiring an Internet connection and authentication through the Origin client before a person can play the game. While also serving as DRM, this system allows players to interact with not only other cities in real time, but a larger global market for buying and selling resources. The game can be run in sandbox mode to allow players more freedom to create whatever they want, but they cannot interact with other cities and the global economy in sandbox mode.</p><h3>New Features</h3><h4>GlassBox Engine</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2170517" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2170517-glassbox_logo_stroke_midsize_0.png" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2170517-glassbox_logo_stroke_midsize_0.png" data-ref-id="1300-2170517"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39388/2170517-glassbox_logo_stroke_midsize_0.png"></a></figure><p style="">SimCity retains the scope of previous games, but scales back some gameplay aspects in order to expand upon others. For example, cities are scaled back in geographic size and are not as large as in previous games. This design decision is attributed to the game''s <a href="/glassbox-game-engine/3015-7404/" data-ref-id="3015-7404" data-mce-href="/glassbox-game-engine/3015-7404/">GlassBox engine</a>, which was purposefully developed for this SimCity game, and is said to visually represent every element that makes up a city. As an example, each citizen (also called a "Sim") will be seen performing daily tasks, such as walking around, going to work, driving to school, and heading home. The GlassBox engine also allows players to view the individual wants and desires of each Sim in a city.</p><p style="">Due to the amount of data that is visually represented within the game, the size of any one city had to be made smaller so that the game could be playable on a larger range of computer hardware. This also made cities much less self-sustainable, which in turn pushes players to take advantage of the always-online multiplayer to interact with other players in the same region, in order to share resources and ease management of cities.</p><h4>Social Flow</h4><p style="">One of the new primary additions to the franchise is the "Social Flow", or the ability of the player''s city to impact other cities surrounding it, in what''s called a region. Each region can have up to 16 cities within it. Players can choose to control each city plot within their region, or to open plots up to allow friends or any other SimCity players to be able to build in the region. This can lead to both positive and negative effects. For example, a player can create an entirely industrial city that provides jobs for people living in another nearby city, but pollution from the industrial city may also make its way to that same residential neighborhood. The game also allows the sharing of resources between cities, letting players sell any and all resources and waste, from electricity to garbage, to other cities within a region.</p><p style="">Each region has one region-wide project that multiple cities can contribute money and resources to completing. Cities can also be abandoned, opening them up to other players.</p><h4>Buildings Editor</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2228798" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228798-simcitysmeltingplant.jpg" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228798-simcitysmeltingplant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2228798"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2228798-simcitysmeltingplant.jpg"></a><figcaption>In SimCity buildings and structures are customizable too</figcaption></figure><p style="">Similarly to the editor in <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/spore/3025-909/" data-ref-id="3025-909" data-mce-href="http://www.giantbomb.com/spore/3025-909/">Spore</a>, individual buildings can be upgraded and modified in a modular manner. For example, instead of buying two coal plants and placing them next to each other, the player can add extra smokestacks to an existing plant, increasing its capacity. This even applies to utilities such as police and fire stations, which can be made more effective through upgrades.</p><h2>MAC OS Version</h2><p style="">According to a <a href="http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/simcity-mac-faq" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.simcity.com/en_US/blog/article/simcity-mac-faq">blog post</a> on the official SimCity website, the delay between the PC and Mac releases of the game is due to the Mac version being a native MAC OS application, as opposed to a port of the Windows version.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style="">The game was initially generally well-received by game critics, at one point holding a metacritic score of 95 out of 100. However, reviews submitted after the game''s release to the public were far more negative due to the persistent server issues which, by nature of the game''s always-online gameplay and DRM requirements, heavily impacted the experience of playing the game. SimCity currently holds a <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/simcity/critic-reviews" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/simcity/critic-reviews">metacritic score</a> of 71 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, a reception that the review-aggregator website qualifies as "generally favorable".</p><p style="">The current metacritic user score is very negative, averaging at 1.6 out of 10 based on over 2690 ratings - the vast majority of which gave the game a score of 4 or less.</p><table class="mceItemTable"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Publication (aggregators in bold)</th><th scope="col">Score</th><th scope="col">User Score Avg.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Metacritic</strong></em></td><td><a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/simcity" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/simcity"><em><strong>79/100</strong></em></a></td><td><em><strong>1.6 out of 10</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>GameRankings</strong></em></td><td><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/simcity-review/1900-563/" data-ref-id="1900-563" data-mce-href="http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/simcity-review/1900-563/"><em><strong>76.12%</strong></em></a></td><td><em><strong>n/a</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td>Giant Bomb</td><td>3/5</td><td>1.67 out of 5</td></tr><tr><td>GameSpot</td><td><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/simcity/reviews/simcity-review-6405012/" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.gamespot.com/simcity/reviews/simcity-review-6405012/">5.0/10</a></td><td>3.8 out of 10</td></tr><tr><td>Game Trailers</td><td><a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/games/7rs6lt/simcity" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.gametrailers.com/games/7rs6lt/simcity">8.0/10</a></td><td>6.4 out of 10</td></tr><tr><td>PC Gamer</td><td><a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/review/simcity-review/" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.pcgamer.com/review/simcity-review/">69/100</a></td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Polygon</td><td><a href="http://www.polygon.com/game/simcity-2013/2630" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.polygon.com/game/simcity-2013/2630">4/10</a></td><td>n/a</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="">Russ Pitts of Polygon originally <a href="http://www.polygon.com/game/simcity-2013/2630" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.polygon.com/game/simcity-2013/2630">gave the game a 9.5</a>, lauding the game as a well-engineered addictive experience in which "every element of this game has been perfectly and patiently engineered to engender an endorphin rush of accomplishment", concluding that SimCity "is in every way the fully realized evolution of the franchise and a much welcome iteration". Giant Bomb''s own Alex Navarro was less positive in <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/simcity-review/1900-563/" data-ref-id="1900-563" data-mce-href="http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/simcity-review/1900-563/">his review</a>, giving the game a 3 out of 5 score, along with a very mixed narrative. He wrote that SimCity felt like two different games, one of them "a brilliant, vibrantly realized reboot of Maxis'' classic SimCity franchise" and the other a "stricter game... one more dedicated to a single-minded way of cooperative thinking".</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2422011" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png" data-ref-id="1300-2422011"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png"></a><figcaption> Implementation of a standard size-limit to every city drew criticism</figcaption></figure><p style="">Alex negatively dubbed the always-on co-op multiplayer facet SimCity a "skeletal structure in which the city building meat of the game has been somewhat awkwardly stuffed into", while Pitts said that he enjoyed seeing "disparate towns form an interconnected whole that is stronger than its parts", but also cautioned that the "fun of cooperation will, of course, vary depending on with whom you are attempting to cooperate".</p><p style="">Reviews published days after the game''s launch were far more negative in their appreciation, since the server issues were unexpectedly persisting. Online publications such as GameSpot which occasionally publish a review prior to a game''s release seemingly waited out to account server issues into their review. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/simcity/reviews/simcity-review-6405012/" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://www.gamespot.com/simcity/reviews/simcity-review-6405012/">gave SimCity a 5.0</a> stating "SimCity is both a fun city builder and a broken product, equal parts joy and misery".</p><h3>Server Issues at Launch</h3><p style="">The game''s always-online <a href="/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/" data-ref-id="3015-1704" data-mce-href="/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/">DRM</a> requirement drew heavy criticism upon the game''s launch, since server errors weren''t allowing players to enter the game. Some players weren''t even able to download the game, and others reported spontaneous server disconnects while playing SimCity.</p><p style="">Eventually in an alleged attempt to decrease server malfunctions, some features were removed from the game. These included the ability to increase gameplay speed (referred in-game as "Cheetah" speed) as well as leaderboards and achievements. However, reports from both players and professional critics indicated that these measures had not visibly stabilized the servers.</p><p style="">Because EA issued early reviews from popular video game editorial entities, many professional reviewers didn''t take these controversies into account on their review. Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report issued a <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/why-you-shouldnt-trust-our-simcity-review" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false" data-mce-href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/why-you-shouldnt-trust-our-simcity-review">cautionary article</a> titled "Why you shouldn''t trust our SimCity ''review''", alerting readers that the experience reviewers had been exposed to wasn''t prone to server issues because "EA knew exactly how many reviewers would be playing the game", and therefore not necessarily indicative of the experience players would have with the game at launch.</p><p style="">Russ Pitts'' <a href="/review-jashin-fukkatsu/3030-34641/" data-ref-id="3030-34641" data-mce-href="/review-jashin-fukkatsu/3030-34641/">review</a> at Polygon had its score reduced from an 8 to a 4, after having been downgraded from an original 9.5 to an 8. The first score reduction was due to early server issues, while the second, much harsher downgrade was due to the removal of gameplay features that were seen as crucial. Pitts wrote that "EA''s decision to remove certain features of the game in order to attempt to stabilize server performance has resulted in a dramatic change to the way <i>SimCity</i> is played".</p><p style="">On March 7th, just two days after the game''s launch, Amazon temporarily stopped selling digital copies of the game.</p><p style="">As part of its efforts to re-endear customers to after all of the server issues, EA is handing out one free Origin game to all players, from a choice of <a href="/battlefield-3/3030-27006/" data-ref-id="3030-27006" data-mce-href="/battlefield-3/3030-27006/">Battlefield 3</a>, <a href="/bejeweled-3/3030-33019/" data-ref-id="3030-33019" data-mce-href="/bejeweled-3/3030-33019/">Bejeweled 3</a>, <a href="/dead-space-3/3030-38270/" data-ref-id="3030-38270" data-mce-href="/dead-space-3/3030-38270/">Dead Space 3</a>, <a href="/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/" data-ref-id="3030-29935" data-mce-href="/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/">Mass Effect 3</a>, <a href="/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/" data-ref-id="3030-37580" data-mce-href="/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a>, <a href="/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/" data-ref-id="3030-38497" data-mce-href="/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</a>, <a href="/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/" data-ref-id="3030-25709" data-mce-href="/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/">Plants vs. Zombies</a> and <a href="/simcity-4/3030-4736/" data-ref-id="3030-4736" data-mce-href="/simcity-4/3030-4736/">SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</a>.

Each map has one major Levolution event that significantly alters the terrain of the map, such as a toppling skyscraper in the map Siege of Shanghai, or a destroyer ship beaching onto an island in Paracel Storm.</p><h4 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Commander Mode</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2497511" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png" data-ref-id="1300-2497511"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/2497511-bf4+commander+mode.png"></a><figcaption>Commander Mode is back in Battlefield 4</figcaption></figure><p style="">Battlefield 4 also sees the return of Commander Mode, last seen in <a href="/battlefield-2/3030-16866/" data-ref-id="3030-16866">Battlefield 2</a>. In this mode, the player (who does not take up a spot on their team''s leaderboard) provides aid to their team through intelligence and offensive support. Additionally, the Commander can select any player on their team and see a picture-in-picture view of that player''s screen. This mode can even be played using mobile devices without connecting to the game via console or PC. Commander Mode is available only in Conquest, Rush, and Obliteration game modes.</p><h4 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Classes</h4><p style="">Battlefield 4 retains the same four classes as the previous game, with a few alterations in available capabilities &amp; gadgets:</p><ul><li style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;"><strong>Assault:</strong> Largely the same as before, the assault class carries assault rifles &amp; medical packs, with the option of carrying <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/defibrillator/3055-3443/" data-ref-id="3055-3443">defibrillators</a> or grenade/smoke launchers.</li><li style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;"><strong>Engineer:</strong> The engineer''s main weapon class has been changed to PDWs instead of carbines. This class is again the anti-vehicle class, with the ability to carry RPGs and mines.</li><li style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;"><strong>Support:</strong> On top of ammo packs, <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/c4/3055-896/" data-ref-id="3055-896">C4</a>, and <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/claymore/3055-1272/" data-ref-id="3055-1272">claymores</a>, the support class also has remote controlled mortars available. They also have an increased ability for suppressive fire than the other classes.</li><li style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;"><strong>Recon:</strong> This class now has C4 and claymores available to them, as well as throwable motion sensors (last seen in Bad Company 2.) They also have the new ability to adjust sniper scopes to compensate for distance, known as "zeroing."</li></ul><h3>Game Modes</h3><p style="">There are 7 game modes available at launch. Five return from Battlefield 3, with two new modes (Obliteration and Defuse) introduced:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Mode</th><th scope="col">Player Count (X360, PS3)</th><th scope="col">Player Count (XOne, PS4, PC)</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/conquest-mode/3015-1099/" data-ref-id="3015-1099">Conquest</a></td><td><p style="">24</p></td><td><p style="">64</p></td><td>The classic Battlefield game mode where teams battle for control of flags on the map, with the team that holds less flags bleeding respawn tickets.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/assault/3015-3294/" data-ref-id="3015-3294">Rush</a></td><td><p style="">24</p></td><td><p style="">32</p></td><td>The staple "attack &amp; defend" game mode, where the attackers try to arm and destroy two MCOM stations in each zone, while the defending team defends them.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="//www.giantbomb.com/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/" data-ref-id="3015-2463">Team Deathmatch</a></td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>Two teams of 10 players face-off to reach the target score of kills in a round.</td></tr><tr><td>Squad Deathmatch</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>Similar to Team Deathmatch, except 4 teams of 5 players each battle each other to reach the target score first.</td></tr><tr><td>Domination</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>Very similar to Conquest, but with smaller teams, smaller maps, and no vehicles.

Players can be revived one time before they are permanently removed from the round.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=""> </p><h3>Maps</h3><p style="">There are ten maps available at launch. All game modes are playable on all the maps:</p><ul><li><strong>Dawnbreaker</strong> - A map that takes place just before dawn in and around the streets of an urban landscape. As time progresses, the sun comes up, and players can trigger underground gas pipes to explode and destroy the boulevard.</li><li><strong>Flood Zone</strong> - Another city map, this one allows for much of the fighting to occur along the rooftops. Players can destroy a levee and flood the streets, pushing the fighting to higher ground.</li><li><strong>Golmud Railway</strong> - A large, open prairie with a railway running through it, this map allows players to detonate IEDs causing large explosions in the open field. In conquest, one of the control points is a moving traincar.</li><li><strong>Hainan Resort</strong> - This map takes place in and around a large hotel in along a tropical coast. The large hotel in the middle can have either side collapsed</li><li><strong>Lancang Dam</strong> - A coastal expanse that features a large defunct dam, which can be collapsed with explosives, creating a deadly avalanche of debris.</li><li><strong>Operation Locker</strong> - A mostly indoor map through an abandoned prison, this map features lockable cell doors and a collapsable guard tower located in the center of the complex.</li><li><strong>Paracel Storm</strong> - This map is a series of islands that features destroyed warships to battle for. As time progresses, a large tropical storm rolls through, and players can unleash a destroyer ship to crash into one of the islands.</li><li><strong>Rogue Transmission</strong> - This map features a huge satellite to fight over and under. Players can destroy the cables holding the telescope over the dish, sending it toppling into the center.</li><li><strong>Siege of Shanghai</strong> - This map is another large urban environment, which features a huge skyscraper in the middle with a capture point on top. By exploding the supports of this building, players can send the entire structure crashing to the ground, creating a new control point.</li><li><strong>Zavod 311</strong> - This map centers around an abandoned tank factory, and if players can find a computer they can arm and detonate a warhead, which will send a large smokestack tumbling to the ground.</li></ul><h3>Battlepacks</h3><p style="">Battlepacks are an additional way to unlock items in multiplayer. They are awarded at set intervals by leveling up both soldiers and weapons. Much like the weapon packs in <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/" data-ref-id="3030-29935">Mass Effect 3</a>, items granted in Battlepacks are randomized. The items awarded are weapon attachments such as scopes and silencers, as well as cosmetic variants of accessories such as new knives, dog tags, soldier camouflages, weapon/vehicle paints, experience boosts, and more.</p><p style="">Items contained in Battlepacks have three levels of <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/" data-ref-id="3015-4702">color-coded</a> rarity; Standard (grey), Advanced (white), Superior (blue), &amp; Distinguished (orange).</p><p style="">There are three tiers of Battlepacks; Bronze, Silver, &amp; Gold, as well as black Weapon Packs. The Bronze Pack will contain three items: two Standard ones, and one that has a chance of being Advanced. The quantity and rarity of the items increase in the Silver and Gold Packs. The Weapon Pack is aimed specifically at the noted weapon and provides weapon accessories for that weapon.</p><p style=""> </p><h2 style="margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;">Downloadable Content</h2><p style="">There will be five expansion packs released for Battlefield 4 that will feature new maps, game modes, weapons and more. Each expansion will be available individually for purchase, or can be bought in a <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/dlc-season-pass/3015-7186/" data-ref-id="3015-7186">bundle</a> with a membership to Battlefield Premium.</p><h3>Second Assault</h3><p style="">The first expansion to be released is Second Assault, which takes 4 maps from Battlefield 3, Operation Metro, Caspian Border, Gulf of Oman, &amp; Operation Firestorm, and updates them in the new Frostbite 3 engine. A new game mode of Capture the Flag is available in this expansion as well.</p><p style="">Other expansions to be released over the course of 2014:</p><ul><li>China Rising</li><li>Naval Strike</li><li>Dragon''s Teeth</li><li>Final Stand</li></ul><p style=""> </p><h2>Pre-Unveiling</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2456720" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2456720"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39388/2456720-bf4_unveil_invite_metreon_sf.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The game was revealed during a promotion for <a href="/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/" data-ref-id="3030-37580">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a>, allowing beta access to those who pre-order Warfighter, or purchase the Limited Edition.</p><p style="">At a company meeting on February 19, 2013, store managers and CEO of Gamestop were given a <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/303993777167667200" rel="nofollow" data-ref-id="false">sneak peak</a> of Battlefield 4.</p><p style="">Media were sent an invite via email on March 15th, 2013, to an unveiling event hosted at AMC Metreon in San Francisco.</p><p style="">On March 20th, 2013, EA created a teaser site that would slowly show artwork from the game as more members logged into the site.

All of these zones except the starting zones for the new races can be quickly accessed via portals in <a href="/orgrimmar/3035-74/" data-ref-id="3035-74">Orgrimmar</a> or <a href="/stormwind-city/3035-195/" data-ref-id="3035-195">Stormwind</a>, once the introductory quests for the zone have been completed. It is worth noting that the Cataclysm zones start strictly at level 80, instead of starting two levels before the former cap like the Outlands and Northrend zones.</p><h3>Gilneas</h3><p style=""><a href="/gilneas/3035-2481/" data-ref-id="3035-2481">Gilneas</a> is a human nation located directly south of <a href="/silverpine-forest/3035-807/" data-ref-id="3035-807">Silverpine</a> Forest on the continent of Lordaeron.

Located east of Azshara in Kalimdor, the player causes Mount Kajaro to erupt, forcing the evacuation of Kezan. Fleeing across the Great Sea, the goblins become shipwrecked on the <a href="/lost-isles/3035-2482/" data-ref-id="3035-2482">Lost Isles</a>, after getting caught in Alliance-Horde crossfire. As Kezan is destroyed as part of the starting goblin storyline, players other than level 1-6 goblins cannot travel to this island.</p><h3>Lost Isles</h3><p style="">The <a href="/lost-isles/3035-2482/" data-ref-id="3035-2482">Lost Isles</a> is a new zone located off the coast of Kalimdor, east of Azshara and is the Goblin (5-12) starting zone in WoW: Cataclysm. After the Cataclysm destroyed Isle of Kezan, the shipwreck''s survivors washed ashore on the Lost Isles off the coast of Kalimdor, where they discover the island''s dense jungles and the resourceful goblins find themselves under the protection and safety of the Horde. Like Kezan, players other than level 6-12 goblins cannot reach the Lost Isles.</p><h3>Hyjal</h3><p style=""><a href="/mount-hyjal/3035-600/" data-ref-id="3035-600">Mount Hyjal</a> is the name of a massive mount in northern Kalimdor and is a level (80-82) zone in the new expansion.</p><p style=""><a href="/ragnaros/3005-3577/" data-ref-id="3005-3577">Ragnaros</a> is back from the Plane of Fire and wants to burn down the World Tree in Mount Hyjal. <a href="/furion-stormrage/3005-638/" data-ref-id="3005-638">Malfurion Stormrage</a> is back to defend the World Tree along with the armies of Cenarius.</p><h3>Sunken City of Vashj''ir</h3><p style="">The <a href="/sunken-city-of-vashjir/3035-2483/" data-ref-id="3035-2483">Sunken City of Vashj''ir</a> is be the first underwater zone, level (80-82) and was the home city of <a href="/queen-azshara/3005-12909/" data-ref-id="3005-12909">Queen Azshara</a> and <a href="/lady-vashj/3005-2994/" data-ref-id="3005-2994">Lady Vashj</a> before the original sundering. In the center of the city is the gateway to the Abyssal Maw (<i>Elemental Plane of Water</i>) which contains a 5-man dungeon and will feature a raid instance in a future content patch. New underwater mounts are available and have the same speed as normal flying mounts.</p><h3>Deepholm</h3><p style=""><a href="/deepholm/3035-2484/" data-ref-id="3035-2484">Deepholm</a> is a large underground zone beneath the Maelstrom in the center of the Azeroth ocean. It contains one new dungeon, the <a href="/the-stonecore/3035-3300/" data-ref-id="3035-3300">Stonecore</a>, for level 82 players on normal difficulty. The storyline of this zone revolves around the conflict between Therazane, the queen of the stone elementals, and the twilight cultists attempting to manipulate the Maelstrom.</p><h3>Uldum</h3><p style=""><a href="/uldum/3035-2485/" data-ref-id="3035-2485">Uldum</a> is a level (83-84) zone south of <a href="/ungoro-crater/3035-2062/" data-ref-id="3035-2062">Un''goro Crater</a>, on the southern coast of Kalimdor. The zone contains two new dungeons inspired by ancient Egypt and is a rumored to hold a "<i>superweapon</i>" as well as the Tol''vir, an ancient race of stone-like cat people created by the titans. The zone also contains the entrance to the Skywall. The largest quest chain in this zone is one big Indiana Jones parody.</p><h3>Twilight Highlands</h3><p style="">The <a href="/twilight-highlands/3035-2486/" data-ref-id="3035-2486">Twilight Highlands</a> features Grim Batol, a level (84-85) zone near Wetlands and is the new Twilight''s Hammer base in Azeroth.</p><h3>Tol Barad</h3><p style=""><a href="/tol-barad/3035-2487/" data-ref-id="3035-2487">Tol Barad</a> is a Level 85 end game zone. The zone is seperated into two subzones. Tol Barad Island is an Outdoor PVP zone in the Style of Wintergrasp, and contains a raid dungeon and daily quests only available to the faction that controls the zone.

Theories regarding their history abound, yet the Worgens'' origins remain steeped in mystery. The worgen''s first appearance in the Eastern Kingdoms has been traced back to the Third War, when the <a href="/archmage-arugal/3005-10603/" data-ref-id="3005-10603">Archmage Arugal</a> utilized the wolf-beasts as a weapon against the Scourge. Arugal''s weapons soon turned against him and the curse of the Worgen rapidly spread among the human population, transforming ordinary men and women into ravenous, feral creatures.</p><p style="">There are those among the Gilneans, however, who cling to hope. Many believe that a treatment for the Worgen curse may exist, although others have nearly given up, fearful that if the Greymane Wall should fall, their humanity will be lost forever. Venturing forth from Gilneas and seeking help from the Alliance, they have decided to join them, to combat the new threats of the Cataclysm.</p><p style="">Worgen are able to play as either; <b>Warrior</b>, <b>Rogue</b>, <b>Druid</b>, <b>Hunter</b>, <b>Mage</b>, <b>Warlock</b>, <b>Priest</b> or <b>Death Knight</b>.

The trolls used this potent mineral for their voodoo rituals, but it had an unexpected effect on the slaves who were in contact with it: kaja''mite generated a startling new cunning and intelligence in the goblins.</p><p style="">The goblins'' natural greed soon lifted them to prominence as masters of mercantilism. Great fortunes were amassed and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for fleets of goblin trading ships. By the end of the Third War, goblins were providing weaponry, vehicles, and devious services to both the Horde and the Alliance, but recently, the goblins of Kezan have found a new enemy in the Alliance and have driven some trade princes from their comfortable neutrality. Reforging old pacts with their one-time allies, the goblins have been welcomed back into the Horde.</p><p style="">Goblin are able to play as either; <b>Warrior</b>, <b>Rogue</b>, <b>Shaman</b>, <b>Hunter</b>, <b>Mage</b>, <b>Warlock</b>, <b>Priest</b> or <b>Death Knight</b>.</p><h2>New Features and Major Changes</h2><p style="">Aside from the new zones and races, Cataclysm features a number of other changes.</p><h3>Guild Advancement</h3><p style="">Guild advancement allows guilds to level in a way similar to characters. There are 25 guild levels, and guild members can earn experience for their guild through completing quests, killing dungeon or raid bosses while in parties made up of at least 80% guild members, and winning rated battleground matches in raids made up of at least 80% guild members. At each level all guild members gain a new perk which includes advantages such as 10% additional experience gain while leveling, faster hearthstone cooldown, and a mass resurrection power which can be used on guild raids.</p><p style="">Guild achievements do not contribute towards leveling, but may unlock certain rewards which can be purchased by the guild members of appropriate reputation with the guild. These include vanity pets, recipes for feasts, heirloom gear, and more.</p><p style="">Guild reputation is earned on an individual basis, and ensures that a player must contribute to the progression of the guild in order to take full advantage of the rewards. Whenever a player earns XP for the guild, he also receives reputation with the guild.</p><h3>Getting Around</h3><p style="">Newly added to the game are Flight Master''s License and Master Riding. Flight Master''s License allows flying in Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, and Deepholm. It is available at level 60 and costs 200-250g depending on your faction with the trainer. Master Riding allows you to ride ALL flying mounts at 310% flight speed. It is available at level 70 and costs 4000-5000g depending on your faction with the trainer.</p><p style="">City portals have been removed from Dalaran and Shattrath. In Dalaran, in place of the city portals are now class trainers. Players looking for quick travel, especially between continents or expansions, may want to consider use of a mage. Portals to Blasted Lands, however, do still exist. Many new flightpoints have been added to most zones in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.</p><p style="">Orgrimmar and Stormwind contain portals to all six level 80-85 zones added in Cataclysm, which are activated to players as the complete the introductory quests in each zone.</p><h3>Inscription</h3><p style="">Inscription has gotten an overhaul to allow for further customization of your character. Glyphs have been divided into three tiers instead of two, namely Minor, Major, and Prime.</p><ul><li>Minor glyphs make small changes such as removing reagent costs or changing the visuals of certain spells.</li><li>Major glyphs are fun glyphs which will either make something work differently or improve your dps in a way that''s hard to spreadsheet out.</li><li>Prime Glyphs are unambiguous dps/healing/survivability upgrades.</li></ul><p style="">Furthermore Glyphs have been changed to function like skills, in that you will effectively "learn" one by using it, adding it to a list of which a set number may be chosen at a time.</p><h3>New Profession: Archaeology</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1117877-archaeology.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1117877" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1117877-archaeology.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1117877"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1246/1117877-archaeology.jpg"></a><figcaption>The interface for the new profession, Archaeology</figcaption></figure><p style="">Archaeology is the new secondary profession (cooking, fishing, first aid) in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Archaeology allows the player to find artifacts scattered across Azeroth. There are two kinds of artifacts: One of them is "lore artifacts". These will teach you about the world... of Warcraft. Occasionally archaeologists will complete Rare artifacts instead, which can be fun/vanity items or epic gear that binds to account.</p><h3>General Profession Changes</h3><p style="">Specializations for Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Tailoring have been completely removed. Recipes previously only available to a specific specialization under one of those profession may now be learned by anyone with the proper skill level in their particular profession.</p><h3>Mastery</h3><p style="">Mastery is the new stat for Cataclysm gear. In addition to much, much larger base stats (strength stamina, intellect etc.) the thing that will make players want new gear is mastery. Mastery is a stat that makes you better at what you do. Every spec has one different mastery bonus.</p><p style="">Each of these mastery bonuses is uniquely designed for that spec. Discipline priests get stronger shields, restoration druids get stronger heal-over-time spells, combat rogues get a chance for an extra attack, protection warriors get extra block chance, etc. More mastery means a stronger mastery bonus.</p><h3>Cataclysm Stat &amp; System Changes</h3><ul><li><b>Stamina:</b> Because of the way Blizzard assigned Strength, Agility, and Intellect, non-plate wearers will end up with more Stamina than before. Health pools are much closer between plate-wearers and other classes than they were in <a href="/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/" data-ref-id="3030-20701">WotLK</a>.</li><li><b>Spirit:</b> Can now only be found on healing gear. Non-healing casters have other systems in place to regenerate mana.</li><li><b>Intellect:</b> Will now grant Spell Power and provide less mana regen than it currently does.</li><li><b>Haste:</b> Haste has become more attractive for melee classes by allowing them to recover resources such as energy and runes more quickly.</li><li><b>Block Rating:</b> Block has been redesigned to scale better. Blocked attacks will simply hit for 30% less damage. Block rating will improve the chance to block, though overall block chances will be lower than they are in WotLK.</li><li><b>Parry:</b> Parry no longer provides 100% avoidance and no longer speeds up attacks. Instead, the next attack will each hit for 50% damage.</li><li><b>Resilience:</b> This only affects damage done by players and critical damage done by players. It does not impact crit chance, mana drains, or other such effects.</li><li><b>Spell Power:</b> This has been removed from all armor, but can still be found on caster weapons. Intellect now grants Spell Power to compensate for this.</li></ul><h3>Talent Tree Revamp</h3><p style="">All of the talent trees have been revamped. In vanilla WoW, players had 51 talent points to spend; in Burning Crusade it grew to 61, and in Wrath they ended up with 71 points. Rather than seeing it go to 76, Blizzard decided to consolidate the trees. A level 85 player will receive only 41 talent points. Instead of getting a talent point every level, a player earns one point every <i>other</i> level; this is usually offset with skills to train, creating a back-and-forth between new skills and new talent points to augment them.</p><p style="">Furthermore, players are presented with a choice at level 10 that allows them to pick a branch of their talent tree that they''d like to specialize in. As an example, a Warrior could choose to specialize in Arms, Protection or Fury, receiving a handful of specialization-specific passive talents and a few abilities that are only available to that specialization (Arms - Mortal Strike / Protection - Shield Slam / Fury - Bloodthirst).</p><p style=""><b>Cataclysm Class Changes</b></p><p style="">Each class received major overhauls to their talent trees, and many classes had spells/abilities changed to be made available at different levels than they previously were. Some spells/abilities have also had their visual effect changed. Most, if not all, classes will have to visit a trainer upon their first log-in after patch 4.0.3 to train in spells/abilities that were either not previously available to them, or that have been altered in some major way.</p><h3>Dungeons and Raids</h3><p style="">There are eight new 5-player dungeons, available in both regular and Heroic modes. In addition, four 10- and 25-player raid dungeons for Cataclysmâ€™s launch.</p><p style=""><b>Dungeons</b></p><ul><li>Blackrock Caverns (80-81)</li><li>Throne of the Tides (80-81)</li><li>The Abyssal Maw (82-84)</li><li>The Stonecore (82-84)</li><li>Vortex Pinnacle (82-84)</li><li>Lost City of Tol''vir (85)</li><li>Halls of Origination (85)</li><li>Grim Batol (85)</li></ul><p style=""><b>Raids</b></p><ul><li>Blackwing Descent (85)</li><li>Bastion of Twilight (85)</li><li>Throne of the Four Winds (85)</li><li>Baradin Hold (85)</li><li>Firelands (85)</li></ul><p style=""><b>Classic 5-player dungeons revamped for level 85 heroic mode</b></p><ul><li>Deadmines</li><li>Shadowfang Keep</li></ul><p style=""><b>Additional Details</b></p><ul><li>The Zul''Gurub raid instance was removed in Cataclysm. For a short time it was a subzone of Northern Stranglethorn and a quest hub. In patch 4.1 it was redone as a new level 85 heroic mode 5-player dungeon.</li><li>Ruins of Ahn''Qiraj has been retuned as a 10-player raid instance instead of the 20-player format it had prior to <i>Cataclysm.</i> It will not increase in level however, so it''s still a level 60 raid.</li><li>Stratholme has been split into two separate dungeons, <b>Stratholme - Main Gate</b> and <b>Stratholme - Service Gate,</b> (Living and Dead). Some bosses and mobs have changed to follow the WotLK story progression.</li></ul><p style="">Cataclysm has more new raiding content at its launch than the previous expansions.</p><h3>Improved Quest Design</h3><p style="">Following the success of ''phased'' story based quests in the <a href="/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/" data-ref-id="3030-20701">Wrath of the Lich King</a> expansion pack, (in particular during the Death Knight starting zone), Cataclysm has expanded on that technology by having even more dramatic phased events and story-heavy quest lines in the new (81-85) zones.</p><p style="">Quests in most zones in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, including starting areas, have also been changed. Changes range from slight to extreme. Some quest lines have been completely removed, others have been revamped, and completely new ones have been added. The quest achievements for Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms have also been changed to reflect quests completed by zone as in Burning Crusade and Lich King, rather than by continent as they were previously.</p><p style="">Quests have also been streamlined in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms in such a way that players can expect to spend less time in each zone completing quests, though they may be completing a similar amount of quests as before. These changes include less "back-and-forth" steps and more quest hubs throughout zones</p><h3>Raid Progression Changes</h3><p style="">The raid system has been ''refined'' with a few changes to the way that players are saved to instances. All raid sizes and difficulties are being combined into a single save, so 10 and 25 man raids will both share the same lockout unlike how players could do both 10 and 25 man versions of the instances in Wrath of the Lich King, now they will only be able to be saved to 10 or 25. Heroic mode works in the same way it did with Icecrown Citadel on a per-boss basis allowing players to activate heroic mode for only the bosses they want instead of doing it on all bosses. Furthermore, both versions of the raid share the same loot, however 25 man bosses will drop more loot then on 10 man so players will still have a reason to progress in 25 man content over 10 man.</p><p style="">The first few raids released in Cataclysm are smaller raids containing only six or seven bosses to allow for players with less play time to be able to raid, whilst the later raids will be larger. Lastly, Blizzard also plans to continue the ''gating'' system that they used with Icecrown Citadel which involves releasing a few bosses of a raid at a time over a few weeks.</p><h3>Badge Changes (PvE and PvP)</h3><p style="">The badge system that was used in the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions has been replaced with a points system, for both PvE and PvP, as a way to make it simpler. There will be two types of points for PvE and PvP that can be earned:</p><p style=""><b>PvE</b></p><ul><li><i>Justice Points</i> - Low-tier, easier-to-get PVE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from certain normal dungeons and all heroic dungeons. (most like the old Emblem of Triumph)</li><li><i>Valor Points</i> - High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the old Emblem of Frost)</li></ul><p style=""><b>PvP</b></p><ul><li><i>Honor Points</i> -Low-tier, easier-to-get PVP points. There is a maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most PvP activities.</li><li><i>Conquest Points</i> -High-tier, harder-to-get PvP points. There is a maximum cap to how many you can own, and a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from winning Rated Battlegrounds or Arenas.</li></ul><p style="">Whenever a PvE raiding tier or new PvP season is released the higher tier points will be converted into low tier points, to prevent stockpiling them. In addition to this, personal rating on PvP gear has been removed.</p><h3>Twin Peaks Battleground</h3><p style="">Twin Peaks is a new 10 vs. 10 battleground in Cataclysm and will be using the same capture-the-flag style as Warsong Gulch. Players must work together to infiltrate the enemy base, steal the flag and returning it to their own base while remaining in control of their own flag. The first faction to capture three enemy flags before time expires will win the battle.</p><p style="">Located within the <a href="/twilight-highlands/3035-2486/" data-ref-id="3035-2486">Twilight Highlands</a>, the Twin Peaks remains a crucial point for staging attacks against the black dragonflight and the Twilight''s Hammer, who are now controling Grim Batol. The Wildhammers now calls upon heroes of the Alliance to help claim the peaks and fend off the Dragonmaw orcs. The Dragonmaw clan, having spent years working to enslave red dragons, once again provides strategic importance to the Horde.</p><h2>Collector''s Edition</h2><p style="">As with The <a href="/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/3030-18603/" data-ref-id="3030-18603">Burning Crusade</a> expansion pack and <a href="/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/3030-20701/" data-ref-id="3030-20701">Wrath of the Lich King</a>, Blizzard Entertainment released a Limited Collector''s Edition of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.</p><p style="">The Limited Edition comes in a special box that contains many exclusives, including:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1469835-worldofwarcraftcataclysmcollectors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1469835" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1469835-worldofwarcraftcataclysmcollectors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1469835"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1246/1469835-worldofwarcraftcataclysmcollectors.jpg"></a><figcaption>An overview of the Collector''s Edition</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Art of the Cataclysm art book, featuring 176 pages of never-before-seen images from the archives of the Blizzard Entertainment cinematics department and the World of Warcraft development team, as well as progressive visuals from multiple stages of development.</li><li>Exclusive in-game pet: He may not be a breaker of worlds just yet, but Lil'' Deathwing will still proudly accompany heroes on their struggle to save Azeroth from his much, much larger counterpart.</li><li>Behind-the-scenes DVD with over an hour of developer interviews and commentaries, as well as a special Warcraft(R) retrospective examining the rich gaming history of the Warcraft universe.</li><li>Soundtrack featuring 10 epic new tracks from Cataclysm, including exclusive bonus tracks.</li><li>Special-edition mouse pad depicting Deathwing menacing the ravaged continents of Azeroth.</li><li>World of Warcraft Trading Card Game cards, including a 60-card starter deck from the Wrathgate series, two extended-art cards, a loot card, and two Collector''s Edition-exclusive hero cards, marking the first appearance of goblin and worgen heroes in the TCG.</li></ul><h2>Alpha/Beta &amp; Release</h2><p style="">As of May 3, 2010, it was officially confirmed through a blizzard blue post that the "Friends and Family Alpha" testing of Cataclysm had started.

They have been unseen in the World of Warcraft until now. In Mists of Pandaria, Pandarens begin on Wandering Isle, a large island shaped in the form of a turtle. New Pandaren characters start off as a neutral race, and over a questline take them to Level 10 which involves helping save the Wandering Isle being sucked into the Maelstrom. Once they complete the questline Pandaren characters are forced to choose a faction, either the <a href="/horde/3015-459/" data-ref-id="3015-459">Horde</a> or the <a href="/alliance/3015-460/" data-ref-id="3015-460">Alliance</a>.</p><p style="">Pandarens are be able to choose Hunters, Mages, Priests, Warriors, Rogues, Shamans or Monks as their class.</p><p style="">Pandaren racials</p><ul><li><b>Bouncy</b> - You take 50% less falling damage.</li><li><b>Inner Peace</b> - Your rested experience bonus lasts twice as long.</li><li><b>Gourmand</b> - Cooking skill increased by 15.</li><li><b>Epicurean</b> - Increase the stat benefits from food by 100%</li><li><b>Quaking Palm</b> - You touch a secret pressure point on an enemy target, putting it to sleep for 3 sec.</li></ul><p style="">Pandaren race mount is the Dragon Turtle.</p><h3>Monk Class</h3><p style="">All races except Goblins and Worgen are able to be monks.</p><ul><li>Uses Chi as its resource</li><li>Uses stances, like Drunken Tiger/Ox</li><li>Monks start at level 1, they are not a Hero class.</li><li>Martial-arts based</li><li>Uses Leather Armor (Agility or Intellect)</li><li>Uses staves and fist weapons for finishing moves, but also be able to use 1H swords, axes and maces.</li></ul><p style="">The three talent trees allow players to assume any role in a party:</p><ul><li>Brewmaster - Tank spec</li><li>Mistweaver - Healing spec</li><li>Windwalker - Melee DPS</li></ul><h2>Pandaria</h2><ul><li>7 new leveling zones to explore</li><li>Single unified continent</li><li>Influenced by Asian landscapes</li><li>Auction House, Bank and Central Questing Hub</li><li>No flying until max level</li></ul><h3>Challenge Dungeons</h3><p style="">Challenge dungeons allow players to attempt to speed run dungeons, earning either a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your completion time.

Roles are no longer be determined by your talents but by your class specialization which is be chosen at 10th level.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61859/2000187-BED0U7CO2QKX1319149708257.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000187" data-size="medium" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61859/2000187-BED0U7CO2QKX1319149708257.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000187"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/61859/2000187-BED0U7CO2QKX1319149708257.jpg"></a><figcaption>The New Paladin Talent Tree</figcaption></figure><p style="">The new talent trees offer one talent point every 15 levels that you can put into one of three talents at that level. For example, a Paladin at level 15 receive one talent point that they can spend in one of three talents, Speed of Light, Long Arm of the Law, or Pursuit of Justice. Then, at level 30, you receive another talent point that you can spend in the next tier of the talent tree, and only in the next tier. So at level 30, a Paladin could spend his one talent point in either Fist of Justice, Repentance, or Seal of Justice, but could not spend it in any of the tier 1 talents (Speed of Light, Long Arm of the Law, or Pursuit of Justice.)</p><p style="">Many abilities that was considered staples to a talent tree for a class became core class abilities, became class specialization abilities, or became talents in the new trees; meaning someone of that class regardless of specialization gained access to the ability.</p><h3>PvE Scenarios</h3><p style="">PvE scenarios will function as sort of mini-instanced-open-world-dungeons. Unlike public quests in other games, PvE scenarios will be instanced group quest chains that can be completed at any level. It was suggested that you can come back to scenarios even after you have far out leveled the area the scenario is featured in, and the scenario itself will scale to the level of you and your party. Meaning that if you skip a PvE scenario in a level 10 zone, you can still complete it at level 90 and it will scale to level 90 for you.</p><p style="">The scenarios themselves were presented as instanced multi-part quests. The example they gave would be along the lines of Goldshire being under attack by kobolds, so the first step would be to kill X number of kobolds attacking the town, then once that is complete you would need to rescue X number of children from the town, and then would finish with fighting a "boss kobold" Goldtooth.</p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61859/2000199-scenarioexamplerlt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000199" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61859/2000199-scenarioexamplerlt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000199"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61859/2000199-scenarioexamplerlt.jpg"></a></figure><p style="">The other proposed use for this would be to create PvE PvP experiences. The example here was for a PvE scenario set in "Grizzly Gulch." Players would take part in a three part quest series revolving around the opposing faction having taken control of Grizzly Gulch and the players trying to take it back for their faction. Step 1 would be to kill 50 NPCs of the opposing faction, which would lead to the players needing to destroy six towers and a barracks, and would end with defeating the boss, General Drake (for the Alliance side.)</p><h3>Pet Battle System</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2000452-pet_battle_system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000452" data-size="small" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2000452-pet_battle_system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2000452"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2000452-pet_battle_system.jpg"></a><figcaption>The interface concept</figcaption></figure><p style="">With Pet Battle System Blizzard makes it possible to fight with companion pets against other companion pets.

To power up a plant, the player clicks on the plant food icon at the bottom of the screen and then clicks on a plant that has been placed. Every plant in the game can be powered up and each plant''s powerup is unique and usually involves a beefed-up version of their usual attack or ability. Plant food is collected from zombies. Throughout a level, zombies will randomly come out with a green glows. This glow signifies that they will drop plant food once killed. Once the plant food is dropped, it floats around the screen until the player clicks on it and collects it, similarly to sun.</p><h4>Powers</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2533598-pvz2-upgrades.png" data-ref-id="1300-2533598" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2533598-pvz2-upgrades.png" data-ref-id="1300-2533598"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2533598-pvz2-upgrades.png"></a><figcaption>Plants vs. Zombies 2 New Powers</figcaption></figure><p style="">Three new abilities the player can use at any time were added to the game: Power Pinch, Power Toss, and Power Zap.

Certain levels will have only one star to collect, and these levels will usually introduce a challenge that dramatically changes the way the game is played; these levels often resemble the <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/minigames/3015-116/" data-ref-id="3015-116">minigames</a> from the original <a href="//www.giantbomb.com/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/" data-ref-id="3030-25709">Plants vs. Zombies</a>.</p><h4>World Map</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2533612-plantsvszombies2-screen5.png" data-ref-id="1300-2533612" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2533612-plantsvszombies2-screen5.png" data-ref-id="1300-2533612"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2533612-plantsvszombies2-screen5.png"></a><figcaption>Egypt-Themed World Map</figcaption></figure><p style="">Plants vs. Zombies 2 plays across three different worlds: an Egypt-themed world, a pirate-themed world, and a wild west-themed world. Each world comes with its own unique world map which players use to select their level. Most levels are unlocked in a linear fashion, beat one level and the next one is unlocked. Certain levels are locked behind special gates and only unlock once the player has acquired enough keys from that world. These gates can also be unlocked with a real-money transaction if the player chooses to do so.</p><h4>Yeti</h4><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2535056-pvz2_cheats_6_redo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2535056" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109148/2535056-pvz2_cheats_6_redo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2535056"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/109148/2535056-pvz2_cheats_6_redo.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Yeti Appears--And He''s Carrying a Lunchbox</figcaption></figure><p style="">The zombie yeti returns from the original Plants vs. Zombies, but this time he has a lunchbox.
